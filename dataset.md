Where information is transferred between the organization and third parties, transfer agreements (including recipient authentication) should be established and maintained to protect information in all forms in transit (see 5.10).Information transfer can happen through electronic transfer, physical storage media transfer and verbal transfer.For all types of information transfer, rules, procedures and agreements should include:a) controls designed to protect transferred information from interception, unauthorized access, copying, modification, misrouting, destruction and denial of service, including levels of access control commensurate with the classification of the information involved and any special controls that are required to protect sensitive information, such as use of cryptographic techniques (see 8.24);b) controls to ensure traceability and non-repudiation, including maintaining a chain of custody for information while in transit;c) identification of appropriate contacts related to the transfer including information owners, risk owners, security officers and information custodians, as applicable;d) responsibilities and liabilities in the event of information security incidents, such as loss of physical storage media or data;e) use of an agreed labelling system for sensitive or critical information, ensuring that the meaning of the labels is immediately understood and that the information is appropriately protected (see 5.13);f) reliability and availability of the transfer service;g) the topic-specific policy or guidelines on acceptable use of information transfer facilities (see 5.10);h) retention and disposal guidelines for all business records, including messages;Local legislation and regulations can exist regarding retention and disposal of business records.i) the consideration of any other relevant legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements (see 5.31, 5.32, 5.33, 5.34) related to transfer of information (e.g. requirements for electronic signatures).Electronic transferRules, procedures and agreements should also consider the following items when using electronic communication facilities for information transfer:a) detection of and protection against malware that can be transmitted through the use of electronic communications (see 8.7);b) protection of communicated sensitive electronic information that is in the form of an attachment;c) prevention against sending documents and messages in communications to the wrong address or number;d) obtaining approval prior to using external public services such as instant messaging, social networking, file sharing or cloud storage;e) stronger levels of authentication when transferring information via publicly accessible networks;f) restrictions associated with electronic communication facilities (e.g. preventing automatic forwarding of electronic mail to external mail addresses);g) advising personnel and other interested parties not to send short message service (SMS) or instant messages with critical information since these can be read in public places (and therefore by unauthorized persons) or stored in devices not adequately protected;h) advising personnel and other interested parties about the problems of using fax machines or services, namely:1) unauthorized access to built-in message stores to retrieve messages;    2) deliberate or accidental programming of machines to send messages to specific numbers. Physical storage media transferWhen transferring physical storage media (including paper), rules, procedures and agreements should also include:a) responsibilities for controlling and notifying transmission, dispatch and receipt;b) ensuring correct addressing and transportation of the message;c) packaging that protects the contents from any physical damage likely to arise during transit and in accordance with any manufacturers' specifications, for example protecting against any environmental factors that can reduce the effectiveness of restoring storage media such as exposure to heat, moisture or electromagnetic fields; using minimum technical standards for packaging and transmission (e.g. the use of opaque envelopes);d) a list of authorized reliable couriers agreed by management;e) courier identification standards;f) depending on the classification level of the information in the storage media to be transported, use tamper evident or tamper-resistant controls (e.g. bags, containers);g) procedures to verify the identification of couriers;h) approved list of third parties providing transportation or courier services depending on the classification of the information;i) keeping logs for identifying the content of the storage media, the protection applied as well as recording the list of authorised recipients, the times of transfer to the transit custodians and receipt at the destination.Verbal transferTo protect verbal transfer of information, personnel and other interested parties should be reminded that they should:a) not have confidential verbal conversations in public places or over insecure communication channels since these can be overheard by unauthorized persons;b) not leave messages containing confidential information on answering machines or voice messages since these can be replayed by unauthorized persons, stored on communal systems or stored incorrectly as a result of misdialling;c) be screened to the appropriate level to listen to the conversation;d) ensure that appropriate room controls are implemented (e.g. sound-proofing, closed door);e) begin any sensitive conversations with a disclaimer so those present know the classification level and any handling requirements of what they are about to hear.Other informationNo other information.",

Where these individuals are contracted through suppliers of services, screening requirements should be included in the contractual agreements between the organization and the suppliers.Information on all candidates being considered for positions within the organization should be collected and handled taking into consideration any appropriate legislation existing in the relevant jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, the organization can be legally required to inform the candidates beforehand about the screening activities.Verification should take into consideration all relevant privacy, PII protection and employment-based legislation and should, where permitted, include the following:a) availability of satisfactory references (e.g. business and personal references);b) a verification (for completeness and accuracy) of the applicant's curriculum vitae;c) confirmation of claimed academic and professional qualifications;d) independent identity verification (e.g. passport or other acceptable document issued by appropriate authorities);e) more detailed verification, such as credit review or review of criminal records if the candidate takes on a critical role.When an individual is hired for a specific information security role, the organization should make sure the candidate:a) has the necessary competence to perform the security role;b) can be trusted to take on the role, especially if the role is critical for the organization.Where a job, either on initial appointment or on promotion, involves the person having access to information processing facilities and, in particular, if these involve handling confidential information (e.g. financial information, personal information or health care information) the organization should also consider further, more detailed verifications.Procedures should define criteria and limitations for verification reviews (e.g. who is eligible to screen people and how, when and why verification reviews are carried out).In situations where verification cannot be completed in a timely manner, mitigating controls should be implemented until the review has been finished, for example:a) delayed onboarding;b) delayed deployment of corporate assets;c) onboarding with reduced access;d) termination of employment.Verification checks should be repeated periodically to confirm ongoing suitability of personnel, depending on the criticality of a person's role.Other informationNo other information.",

Initial awareness, education and training can apply to new personnel and to those who transfer to new positions or roles with substantially different information security requirements.Personnel's understanding should be assessed at the end of an awareness, education or training activity to test knowledge transfer and the effectiveness of the awareness, education and training programme.AwarenessAn information security awareness programme should aim to make personnel aware of their responsibilities for information security and the means by which those responsibilities are discharged.The awareness programme should be planned taking into consideration the roles of personnel in the organization, including internal and external personnel (e.g. external consultants, supplier personnel). The activities in the awareness programme should be scheduled over time, preferably regularly, so that the activities are repeated and cover new personnel. It should also be built on lessons learnt from information security incidents.The awareness programme should include a number of awareness-raising activities via appropriate physical or virtual channels such as campaigns, booklets, posters, newsletters, websites, information sessions, briefings, e-learning modules and e-mails.Information security awareness should cover general aspects such as:a) management's commitment to information security throughout the organization;b) familiarity and compliance needs concerning applicable information security rules and obligations, taking into account information security policy and topic-specific policies, standards, laws, statutes, regulations, contracts and agreements;c) personal accountability for one's own actions and inactions, and general responsibilities towards securing or protecting information belonging to the organization and interested parties;d) basic information security procedures [e.g. information security event reporting (6.8)] and baseline controls [e.g. password security (5.17)];e) contact points and resources for additional information and advice on information security matters, including further information security awareness materials.Education and trainingThe organization should identify, prepare and implement an appropriate training plan for technical teams whose roles require specific skill sets and expertise. Technical teams should have the skills for configuring and maintaining the required security level for devices, systems, applications and services. If there are missing skills, the organization should take action and acquire them.The education and training programme should consider different forms [e.g. lectures or self-studies, being mentored by expert staff or consultants (on-the-job training), rotating staff members to follow different activities, recruiting already skilled people and hiring consultants]. It can use different means of delivery including classroom-based, distance learning, web-based, self-paced and others. Technical personnel should keep their knowledge up to date by subscribing to newsletters and magazines or by attending conferences and events aimed at technical and professional improvement.Other informationWhen composing an awareness programme, it is important not only to focus on the 'what' and 'how', but also the 'why', when possible. It is important that personnel understand the aim of information security and the potential effect, positive and negative, on the organization of their own behaviour.Information security awareness, education and training can be part of, or conducted in collaboration with, other activities, for example general information management, ICT, security, privacy or safety training.",

This can include confidentiality of information, intellectual property and other knowledge obtained, as well as responsibilities contained within any other confidentiality agreement (see 6.6). Responsibilities and duties still valid after termination of employment or contract should be contained in the individual's terms and conditions of employment (see 6.2), contract or agreement. Other contracts or agreements that continue for a defined period after the end of the individual's employment can also contain information security responsibilities.Changes of responsibility or employment should be managed as the termination of the current responsibility or employment combined with the initiation of the new responsibility or employment.Information security roles and responsibilities held by any individual who leaves or changes job roles should be identified and transferred to another individual.A process should be established for the communication of the changes and of operating procedures to personnel, other interested parties and relevant contact persons (e.g. to customers and suppliers).The process for the termination or change of employment should also be applied to external personnel (i.e. suppliers) when a termination occurs of personnel, the contract or the job with the organization, or when there is a change of the job within the organization.Other informationIn many organizations, the human resources function is generally responsible for the overall termination process and works together with the supervising manager of the person transitioning to manage the information security aspects of the relevant procedures. In the case of personnel provided through an external party (e.g. through a supplier), this termination process is undertaken by the external party in accordance with the contract between the organization and the external party.",

Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements are applicable to interested parties and personnel of the organization. Based on an organization's information security requirements, the terms in the agreements should be determined by taking into consideration the type of information that will be handled, its classification level, its use and the permissible access by the other party. To identify requirements for confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements, the following elements should be considered:a) a definition of the information to be protected (e.g. confidential information);b) the expected duration of an agreement, including cases where it can be necessary to maintain confidentiality indefinitely or until the information becomes publicly available;c) the required actions when an agreement is terminated;d) the responsibilities and actions of signatories to avoid unauthorized information disclosure;e) the ownership of information, trade secrets and intellectual property, and how this relates to the protection of confidential information;f) the permitted use of confidential information and rights of the signatory to use the information;g) the right to audit and monitor activities that involve confidential information for highly sensitive circumstances;h) the process for notification and reporting of unauthorized disclosure or confidential information leakage;i) the terms for information to be returned or destroyed at agreement termination;j) the expected actions to be taken in the case of non-compliance with the agreement.The organization should take into consideration the compliance with confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements for the jurisdiction to which they apply (see 5.31, 5.32, 5.33, 5.34).Requirements for confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements should be reviewed periodically and when changes occur that influence these requirements.Other informationConfidentiality and non-disclosure agreements protect the organization's information and inform signatories of their responsibility to protect, use and disclose information in a responsible and authorized manner.",

Remote working environments include those referred to as \"teleworking\", \"telecommuting\", \"flexible workplace\", \"virtual work environments\" and \"remote maintenance\".NOTE   It is possible that not all the recommendations in this guidance can be applied due to local legislation and regulations in different jurisdictions.Organizations allowing remote working activities should issue a topic-specific policy on remote working that defines the relevant conditions and restrictions. Where deemed applicable, the following matters should be considered:a) the existing or proposed physical security of the remote working site, taking into account the physical security of the location and the local environment, including the different jurisdictions where personnel are located;b) rules and security mechanisms for the remote physical environment such as lockable filing cabinets, secure transportation between locations and rules for remote access, clear desk, printing and disposal of information and other associated assets, and information security event reporting (see 6.8);c) the expected physical remote working environments;d) the communications security requirements, taking into account the need for remote access to the organization's systems, the sensitivity of the information to be accessed and passed over the communication link and the sensitivity of the systems and applications;e) the use of remote access such as virtual desktop access that supports processing and storage of information on privately owned equipment;f) the threat of unauthorized access to information or resources from other persons at the remote working site (e.g. family and friends);g) the threat of unauthorized access to information or resources from other persons in public places;h) the use of home networks and public networks, and requirements or restrictions on the configuration of wireless network services;i) use of security measures, such as firewalls and protection against malware;j) secure mechanisms for deploying and initializing systems remotely;k) secure mechanisms for authentication and enablement of access privileges taking into consideration the vulnerability of single-factor authentication mechanisms where remote access to the organization's network is allowed.The guidelines and measures to be considered should include:a) the provision of suitable equipment and storage furniture for the remote working activities, where the use of privately-owned equipment that is not under the control of the organization is not allowed;b) a definition of the work permitted, the classification of information that can be held and the internal systems and services that the remote worker is authorized to access;c) the provision of training for those working remotely and those providing support. This should include how to conduct business in a secure manner while working remotely;d) the provision of suitable communication equipment, including methods for securing remote access, such as requirements on device screen locks and inactivity timers; the enabling of device location tracking; installation of remote wipe capabilities;e) physical security;f) rules and guidance on family and visitor access to equipment and information;g) the provision of hardware and software support and maintenance;h) the provision of insurance;i) the procedures for backup and business continuity;j) audit and security monitoring;k) revocation of authority and access rights and the return of equipment when the remote working activities are terminated.Other informationNo other information.",

The exterior roofs, walls, ceilings and flooring of the site should be of solid construction and all external doors should be suitably protected against unauthorized access with control mechanisms (e.g. bars, alarms, locks). Doors and windows should be locked when unattended and external protection should be considered for windows, particularly at ground level; ventilation points should also be considered;c) alarming, monitoring and testing all fire doors on a security perimeter in conjunction with the walls to establish the required level of resistance in accordance with suitable standards. They should operate in a failsafe manner.Other informationPhysical protection can be achieved by creating one or more physical barriers around the organization's premises and information processing facilities.A secure area can be a lockable office or several rooms surrounded by a continuous internal physical security barrier. Additional barriers and perimeters to control physical access can be necessary between areas with different security requirements inside the security perimeter.

Guidance GeneralAccess points such as delivery and loading areas and other points where unauthorized persons can enter the premises should be controlled and, if possible, isolated from information processing facilities to avoid unauthorized access.The following guidelines should be considered:a) restricting access to sites and buildings to authorized personnel only. The process for the management of access rights to physical areas should include the provision, periodical review, update and revocation of authorizations (see 5.18);b) securely maintaining and monitoring a physical logbook or electronic audit trail of all access and protecting all logs (see 5.33) and sensitive authentication information;c) establishing and implementing a process and technical mechanisms for the management of access to areas where information is processed or stored. Authentication mechanisms include the use of access cards, biometrics or two-factor authentication such as an access card and secret PIN. Double security doors should be considered for access to sensitive areas;d) setting up a reception area monitored by personnel, or other means to control physical access to the site or building;e) inspecting and examining personal belongings of personnel and interested parties upon entry and exit;Local legislation and regulations can exist regarding the possibility of inspecting personal belongings.f) requiring all personnel and interested parties to wear some form of visible identification and to immediately notify security personnel if they encounter unescorted visitors and anyone not wearing visible identification. Easily distinguishable badges should be considered to better identify permanent employees, suppliers and visitors;g) granting supplier personnel restricted access to secure areas or information processing facilities only when required. This access should be authorized and monitored;h) giving special attention to physical access security in the case of buildings holding assets for multiple organizations;i) designing physical security measures so that they can be strengthened when the likelihood of physical incidents increases;j) securing other entry points such as emergency exits from unauthorized access;k) setting up a key management process to ensure the management of the physical keys or authentication information (e.g. lock codes, combination locks to offices, rooms and facilities such as key cabinets) and to ensure a log book or annual key audit and that access to physical keys or authentication information is controlled (see 5.17 for further guidance on authentication information).VisitorsThe following guidelines should be considered:a) authenticating the identity of visitors by an appropriate means;b) recording the date and time of entry and departure of visitors;c) only granting access for visitors for specific, authorized purposes and with instructions on the security requirements of the area and on emergency procedures;d) supervising all visitors, unless an explicit exception is granted. Delivery and loading areas and incoming materialThe following guidelines should be considered:a) restricting access to delivery and loading areas from outside of the building to identified and authorized personnel;b) designing the delivery and loading areas so that deliveries can be loaded and unloaded without delivery personnel gaining unauthorized access to other parts of the building;c) securing the external doors of delivery and loading areas when doors to restricted areas are opened;d) inspecting and examining incoming deliveries for explosives, chemicals or other hazardous materials before they are moved from delivery and loading areas;e) registering incoming deliveries in accordance with asset management procedures (see 5.9 and 7.10) on entry to the site;f) physically segregating incoming and outgoing shipments, where possible;g) inspecting incoming deliveries for evidence of tampering on the way. If tampering is discovered, it should be immediately reported to security personnel.Other informationNo other information.",

Unoccupied areas should be alarmed at all times; cover should also be provided for other areas (e.g. computer or communications rooms).The design of monitoring systems should be kept confidential because disclosure can facilitate undetected break-ins.Monitoring systems should be protected from unauthorized access in order to prevent surveillance information, such as video feeds, from being accessed by unauthorized persons or systems being disabled remotely.The alarm system control panel should be placed in an alarmed zone and, for safety alarms, in a place that allows an easy exit route for the person who sets the alarm. The control panel and the detectors should have tamperproof mechanisms. The system should regularly be tested to ensure that it is working as intended, particularly if its components are battery powered.Any monitoring and recording mechanism should be used taking into consideration local laws and regulations including data protection and PII protection legislation, especially regarding the monitoring of personnel and recorded video retention periods.Other informationNo other information.",

Necessary safeguards should be implemented and changes to threats should be monitored. Specialist advice should be obtained on how to manage risks arising from physical and environmental threats such as fire, flood, earthquake, explosion, civil unrest, toxic waste, environmental emissions and other forms of natural disaster or disaster caused by human beings.Physical premises location and construction should take account of:a) local topography, such as appropriate elevation, bodies of water and tectonic fault lines;b) urban threats, such as locations with a high profile for attracting political unrest, criminal activity or terrorist attacks.Based on risk assessment results, relevant physical and environmental threats should be identified and appropriate controls considered in the following contexts as examples:a) fire: installing and configuring systems able to detect fires at an early stage to send alarms or trigger fire suppression systems in order to prevent fire damage to storage media and to related information processing systems. Fire suppression should be performed using the most appropriate substance with regard to the surrounding environment (e.g. gas in confined spaces);b) flooding: installing systems able to detect flooding at an early stage under the floors of areas containing storage media or information processing systems. Water pumps or equivalent means should be readily made available in case flooding occurs;c) electrical surges: adopting systems able to protect both server and client information systems against electrical surges or similar events to minimize the consequences of such events;d) explosives and weapons: performing random inspections for the presence of explosives or weapons on personnel, vehicles or goods entering sensitive information processing facilities.Other informationSafes or other forms of secure storage facilities can protect information stored therein against disasters such as a fire, earthquake, flood or explosion.Organizations can consider the concepts of crime prevention through environmental design when designing the controls to secure their environment and reduce urban threats. For example, instead of using bollards, statues or water features can serve as both a feature and a physical barrier.",

The use of these devices should be authorized by management.The following guidelines should be considered for the protection of devices which store or process information outside the organization's premises:a) not leaving equipment and storage media taken off premises unattended in public and unsecured places;b) observing manufacturers' instructions for protecting equipment at all times (e.g. protection against exposure to strong electromagnetic fields, water, heat, humidity, dust);c) when off-premises equipment is transferred among different individuals or interested parties, maintaining a log that defines the chain of custody for the equipment including at least names and organizations of those who are responsible for the equipment. Information that does not need to be transferred with the asset should be securely deleted before the transfer;d) where necessary and practical, requiring authorization for equipment and media to be removed from the organization's premises and keeping a record of such removals in order to maintain an audit trail (see 5.14);e) protecting against viewing information on a device (e.g. mobile or laptop) on public transport, and the risks associated with shoulder surfing;f) implementing location tracking and ability for remote wiping of devices.Permanent installation of equipment outside the organization's premises [such as antennas and automated teller machines (ATMs)] can be subject to higher risk of damage, theft or eavesdropping. These risks can vary considerably between locations and should be taken into account in determining the most appropriate measures. The following guidelines should be considered when siting this equipment outside of the organization's premises:a) physical security monitoring (see 7.4);b) protecting against physical and environmental threats (see 7.5);c) physical access and tamper-proofing controls;d) logical access controls.Other informationMore information about other aspects of protecting information storing and processing equipment and user endpoint devices can be found in 8.1 and 6.7.",

The procedures for secure reuse or disposal of storage media containing confidential information should be proportional to the sensitivity of that information. The following items should be considered:a) if storage media containing confidential information need to be reused within the organization, securely deleting data or formatting the storage media before reuse (see 8.10);b) disposing of storage media containing confidential information securely when not needed anymore (e.g. by destroying, shredding or securely deleting the content);c) having procedures in place to identify the items that can require secure disposal;d) many organizations offer collection and disposal services for storage media. Care should be taken in selecting a suitable external party supplier with adequate controls and experience;e) logging the disposal of sensitive items in order to maintain an audit trail;f) when accumulating storage media for disposal, giving consideration to the aggregation effect, which can cause a large quantity of non-sensitive information to become sensitive.A risk assessment should be performed on damaged devices containing sensitive data to determine whether the items should be physically destroyed rather than sent for repair or discarded (see 7.14).Other informationWhen confidential information on storage media is not encrypted, additional physical protection of the storage media should be considered.",

See 7.10 for detailed guidance on secure disposal of storage media and 8.10 for guidance on information deletion.Labels and markings identifying the organization or indicating the classification, owner, system or network, should be removed prior to disposal, including reselling or donating to charity.The organization should consider the removal of security controls such as access controls or surveillance equipment at the end of lease or when moving out of premises. This depends on factors such as:a) its lease agreement to return the facility to original condition;b) minimizing the risk of leaving systems with sensitive information on them for the next tenant (e.g. user access lists, video or image files);c) the ability to reuse the controls at the next facility.Other informationDamaged equipment containing storage media can require a risk assessment to determine whether the items should be physically destroyed rather than sent for repair or discarded. Information can be compromised through careless disposal or re-use of equipment.In addition to secure disk deletion, full-disk encryption reduces the risk of disclosure of confidential information when equipment is disposed of or redeployed, provided that:a) the encryption process is sufficiently strong and covers the entire disk (including slack space, swap files);b) the cryptographic keys are long enough to resist brute force attacks;c) the cryptographic keys are themselves kept confidential (e.g. never stored on the same disk). For further advice on cryptography, see 8.24.Techniques for securely overwriting storage media differ according to the storage media technology and the classification level of the information on the storage media. Overwriting tools should be reviewed to make sure that they are applicable to the technology of the storage media.See ISO/IEC 27040 for detail on methods for sanitizing storage media.",

The topic-specific policy should be communicated to all relevant personnel and consider the following:a) the type of information and the classification level that the user endpoint devices can handle, process, store or support;b) registration of user endpoint devices;c) requirements for physical protection;d) restriction of software installation (e.g. remotely controlled by system administrators);e) requirements for user endpoint device software (including software versions) and for applying updates (e.g. active automatic updating);f) rules for connection to information services, public networks or any other network off premises (e.g. requiring the use of personal firewall);g) access controls;h) storage device encryption;i) protection against malware;j) remote disabling, deletion or lockout;k) backups;l) usage of web services and web applications;m) end user behaviour analytics (see 8.16);n) the use of removable devices, including removable memory devices, and the possibility of disabling physical ports (e.g. USB ports);o) the use of partitioning capabilities, if supported by the user endpoint device, which can securely separate the organization's information and other associated assets (e.g. software) from other information and other associated assets on the device.Consideration should be given as to whether certain information is so sensitive that it can only be accessed via user endpoint devices, but not stored on such devices. In such cases, additional technical safeguards can be required on the device. For example, ensuring that downloading files for offline working is disabled and that local storage such as SD card is disabled.As far as possible, the recommendations on this control should be enforced through configuration management (see 8.9) or automated tools.User responsibilityAll users should be made aware of the security requirements and procedures for protecting user endpoint devices, as well as of their responsibilities for implementing such security measures. Users should be advised to:a) log-off active sessions and terminate services when no longer needed;b) protect user endpoint devices from unauthorized use with a physical control (e.g. key lock or special locks) and logical control (e.g. password access) when not in use; not leave devices carrying important, sensitive or critical business information unattended;c) use devices with special care in public places, open offices, meeting places and other unprotected areas (e.g. avoid reading confidential information if people can read from the back, use privacy screen filters);d) physically protect user endpoint devices against theft (e.g. in cars and other forms of transport, hotel rooms, conference centres and meeting places).A specific procedure taking into account legal, statutory, regulatory, contractual (including insurance) and other security requirements of the organization should be established for cases of theft or loss of user endpoint devices.Use of personal devicesWhere the organization allows the use of personal devices (sometimes known as BYOD), in addition to the guidance given in this control, the following should be considered:a) separation of personal and business use of the devices, including using software to support such separation and protect business data on a private device;b) providing access to business information only after users have acknowledged their duties (physical protection, software updating, etc.), waiving ownership of business data, allowing remote wiping of data by the organization in case of theft or loss of the device or when no longer authorized to use the service. In such cases, PII protection legislation should be considered;c) topic-specific policies and procedures to prevent disputes concerning rights to intellectual property developed on privately owned equipment;d) access to privately owned equipment (to verify the security of the machine or during an investigation), which can be prevented by legislation;e) software licensing agreements that are such that organizations can become liable for licensing for client software on user endpoint devices owned privately by personnel or external party users.Wireless connectionsThe organization should establish procedures for:a) the configuration of wireless connections on devices (e.g. disabling vulnerable protocols);b) using wireless or wired connections with appropriate bandwidth in accordance with relevant topic-specific policies (e.g. because backups or software updates are needed).Other informationControls to protect information on user endpoint devices depend on whether the user endpoint device is used only inside of the organization's secured premises and network connections, or whether it is exposed to increased physical and network related threats outside of the organization.The wireless connections for user endpoint devices are similar to other types of network connections but have important differences that should be considered when identifying controls. In particular, back-up of information stored on user endpoint devices can sometimes fail because of limited network bandwidth or because user endpoint devices are not connected at the times when backups are scheduled.For some USB ports, such as USB-C, disabling the USB port is not possible because it is used for other purposes (e.g. power delivery and display output).",

The following should be considered:a) identifying users who need privileged access rights for each system or process (e.g. operating systems, database management systems and applications);b) allocating privileged access rights to users as needed and on an event-by-event basis in line with the topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.15) (i.e. only to individuals with the necessary competence to carry out activities that require privileged access and based on the minimum requirement for their functional roles);c) maintaining an authorization process (i.e. determining who can approve privileged access rights, or not granting privileged access rights until the authorization process is complete) and a record of all privileges allocated;d) defining and implementing requirements for expiry of privileged access rights;e) taking measures to ensure that users are aware of their privileged access rights and when they are in privileged access mode. Possible measures include using specific user identities, user interface settings or even specific equipment;f) authentication requirements for privileged access rights can be higher than the requirements for normal access rights. Re-authentication or authentication step-up can be necessary before doing work with privileged access rights;g) regularly, and after any organizational change, reviewing users working with privileged access rights in order to verify if their duties, roles, responsibilities and competence still qualify them for working with privileged access rights (see 5.18);h) establishing specific rules in order to avoid the use of generic administration user IDs (such as \"root\"), depending on systems' configuration capabilities. Managing and protecting authentication information of such identities (see 5.17);i) granting temporary privileged access just for the time window necessary to implement approved changes or activities (e.g. for maintenance activities or some critical changes), rather than permanently granting privileged access rights. This is often referred as break glass procedure, and often automated by privilege access management technologies;j) logging all privileged access to systems for audit purposes;k) not sharing or linking identities with privileged access rights to multiple persons, assigning each person a separate identity which allows assigning specific privileged access rights. Identities can be grouped (e.g. by defining an administrator group) in order to simplify the management of privileged access rights;l) only using identities with privileged access rights for undertaking administrative tasks and not for day-to-day general tasks [i.e. checking email, accessing the web (users should have a separate normal network identity for these activities)].Other informationPrivileged access rights are access rights provided to an identity, a role or a process that allows the performance of activities that typical users or processes cannot perform. System administrator roles typically require privileged access rights.Inappropriate use of system administrator privileges (any feature or facility of an information system that enables the user to override system or application controls) is a major contributory factor to failures or breaches of systems.More information related to access management and the secure management of access to information and information and communications technologies resources can be found in ISO/IEC 29146.",

The following should be considered in order to support access restriction requirements:a) not allowing access to sensitive information by unknown user identities or anonymously. Public or anonymous access should only be granted to storage locations that do not contain any sensitive information;b) providing configuration mechanisms to control access to information in systems, applications and services;c) controlling which data can be accessed by a particular user;d) controlling which identities or group of identities have which access, such as read, write, delete and execute;e) providing physical or logical access controls for the isolation of sensitive applications, application data, or systems.Further, dynamic access management techniques and processes to protect sensitive information that has high value to the organization should be considered when the organization:a) needs granular control over who can access such information during what period and in what way;b) wants to share such information with people outside the organization and maintain control over who can access it;c) wants to dynamically manage, in real-time, the use and distribution of such information;d) wants to protect such information against unauthorized changes, copying and distribution (including printing);e) wants to monitor the use of the information;f) wants to record any changes to such information that take place in case a future investigation is required.Dynamic access management techniques should protect information throughout its life cycle (i.e. creation, processing, storage, transmission and disposal), including:a) establishing rules on the management of dynamic access based on specific use cases considering:1) granting access permissions based on identity, device, location or application;2) leveraging the classification scheme in order to determine what information needs to be protected with dynamic access management techniques;b) establishing operational, monitoring and reporting processes and supporting technical infrastructure.Dynamic access management systems should protect information by:a) requiring authentication, appropriate credentials or a certificate to access information;b) restricting access, for example to a specified time frame (e.g. after a given date or until a particular date);c) using encryption to protect information;d) defining the printing permissions for the information;e) recording who accesses the information and how the information is used;f) raising alerts if attempts to misuse the information are detected.Other informationDynamic access management techniques and other dynamic information protection technologies can support the protection of information even when data is shared beyond the originating organization, where traditional access controls cannot be enforced. It can be applied to documents, emails or other files containing information to limit who can access the content and in what way. It can be at a granular level and be adapted over the life cycle of the information.Dynamic access management techniques do not replace classical access management [e.g. using access control lists (ACLs)], but can add more factors for conditionality, real-time evaluation, just-in-time data reduction and other enhancements that can be useful for the most sensitive information. It offers a way to control access outside the organization's environment. Incident response can be supported by dynamic access management techniques as permissions can be modified or revoked at any time.Additional information on a framework for access management is provided in ISO/IEC 29146.",

For example, read access to source code can be broadly provided inside the organization, but write access to source codeis only made available to privileged personnel or designated owners. Where code components are used by several developers within an organization, read access to a centralized code repository should be implemented. Furthermore, if open-source code or third-party code components are used inside an organization, read access to such external code repositories can be broadly provided. However, write access should still be restricted.The following guidelines should be considered to control access to program source libraries in order to reduce the potential for corruption of computer programs:a) managing the access to program source code and the program source libraries according to established procedures;b) granting read and write access to source code based on business needs and managed to address risks of alteration or misuse and according to established procedures;c) updating of source code and associated items and granting of access to source code in accordance with change control procedures (see 8.32) and only performing it after appropriate authorization has been received;d) not granting developers direct access to the source code repository, but through developer tools that control activities and authorizations on the source code;e) holding program listings in a secure environment, where read and write access should be appropriately managed and assigned;f) maintaining an audit log of all accesses and of all changes to source code.If the program source code is intended to be published, additional controls to provide assurance on its integrity (e.g. digital signature) should be considered.Other informationIf access to source code is not properly controlled, source code can be modified or some data in the development environment (e.g. copies of production data, configuration details) can be retrieved by unauthorized persons.",

Where strong authentication and identity verification is required, authentication methodsalternative to passwords, such as digital certificates, smart cards, tokens or biometric means, should beused.Authentication information should be accompanied by additional authentication factors for accessing critical information systems (also known as multi-factor authentication). Using a combination of multiple authentication factors, such as what you know, what you have and what you are, reduces the possibilities for unauthorized accesses. Multi-factor authentication can be combined with other techniques to require additional factors under specific circumstances, based on predefined rules and patterns, such as access from an unusual location, from an unusual device or at an unusual time.Biometric authentication information should be invalidated if it is ever compromised. Biometric authentication can be unavailable depending on the conditions of use (e.g. moisture or aging). To prepare for these issues, biometric authentication should be accompanied with at least one alternative authentication technique.The procedure for logging into a system or application should be designed to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. Log-on procedures and technologies should be implemented considering the following:a) not displaying sensitive system or application information until the log-on process has been successfully completed in order to avoid providing an unauthorized user with any unnecessary assistance;b) displaying a general notice warning that the system or the application or the service should only be accessed by authorized users;c) not providing help messages during the log-on procedure that would aid an unauthorized user (e.g. if an error condition arises, the system should not indicate which part of the data is correct or incorrect);d) validating the log-on information only on completion of all input data;e) protecting against brute force log-on attempts on usernames and passwords [e.g. using completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart (CAPTCHA), requiring password reset after a predefined number of failed attempts or blocking the user after a maximum number of errors];f) logging unsuccessful and successful attempts;g) raising a security event if a potential attempted or successful breach of log-on controls is detected (e.g. sending an alert to the user and the organization's system administrators when a certain number of wrong password attempts has been reached);h) displaying or sending the following information on a separate channel on completion of a successfullog-on:1) date and time of the previous successful log-on;2) details of any unsuccessful log-on attempts since the last successful log-on;i) not displaying a password in clear text when it is being entered; in some cases, it can be required to de-activate this functionality in order to facilitate user log-on (e.g. for accessibility reasons or to avoid blocking users because of repeated errors);j) not transmitting passwords in clear text over a network to avoid being captured by a network \"sniffer\" program;k) terminating inactive sessions after a defined period of inactivity, especially in high risk locations such as public or external areas outside the organization's security management or on user endpoint devices;l) restricting connection duration times to provide additional security for high-risk applications and reduce the window of opportunity for unauthorized access.Other informationAdditional information on entity authentication assurance can be found is ISO/IEC 29115.",

Therefore, managers, service or product owners should monitor the utilization of key system resources.Managers should use capacity information to identify and avoid potential resource limitations and dependency on key personnel which can present a threat to system security or services and plan appropriate action.Providing sufficient capacity can be achieved by increasing capacity or by reducing demand. The following should be considered to increase capacity:a) hiring new personnel;b) obtaining new facilities or space;c) acquiring more powerful processing systems, memory and storage;d) making use of cloud computing, which has inherent characteristics that directly address issues of capacity. Cloud computing has elasticity and scalability which enable on-demand rapid expansion and reduction in resources available to particular applications and services.The following should be considered to reduce demand on the organization's resources:a) deletion of obsolete data (disk space);b) disposal of hardcopy records that have met their retention period (free up shelving space);c) decommissioning of applications, systems, databases or environments;d) optimizing batch processes and schedules;e) optimizing application code or database queries;f) denying or restricting bandwidth for resource-consuming services if these are not critical (e.g. video streaming).A documented capacity management plan should be considered for mission critical systems.Other informationFor more detail on the elasticity and scalability of cloud computing, see ISO/IEC TS 23167.",

Use of malware detection and repair software alone is not usually adequate. The following guidance should be considered:a) implementing rules and controls that prevent or detect the use of unauthorized software [e.g. application allowlisting (i.e. using a list providing allowed applications)] (see 8.19 and 8.32);b) implementing controls that prevent or detect the use of known or suspected malicious websites (e.g. blocklisting);c) reducing vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malware [e.g. through technical vulnerability management (see 8.8 and 8.19)];d) conducting regular automated validation of the software and data content of systems, especially for systems supporting critical business processes; investigating the presence of any unapproved files or unauthorized amendments;e) establishing protective measures against risks associated with obtaining files and software either from or via external networks or on any other medium;f) installing and regularly updating malware detection and repair software to scan computers and electronic storage media. Carrying out regular scans that include:1) scanning any data received over networks or via any form of electronic storage media, for malware before use;2) scanning email and instant messaging attachments and downloads for malware before use. Carrying out this scan at different places (e.g. at email servers, desktop computers) and when entering the network of the organization;3) scanning webpages for malware when accessed;g) determining the placement and configuration of malware detection and repair tools based on risk assessment outcomes and considering:1) defence in depth principles where they would be most effective. For example, this can lead to malware detection in a network gateway (in various application protocols such as email, file transfer and web) as well as user endpoint devices and servers;2) the evasive techniques of attackers (e.g. the use of encrypted files) to deliver malware or the use of encryption protocols to transmit malware;h) taking care to protect against the introduction of malware during maintenance and emergency procedures, which can bypass normal controls against malware;i) implementing a process to authorize temporarily or permanently disable some or all measures against malware, including exception approval authorities, documented justification and review date. This can be necessary when the protection against malware causes disruption to normal operations;j) preparing appropriate business continuity plans for recovering from malware attacks, including all necessary data and software backup (including both online and offline backup) and recovery measures (see 8.13);k) isolating environments where catastrophic consequences can occur;l) defining procedures and responsibilities to deal with protection against malware on systems, including training in their use, reporting and recovering from malware attacks;m) providing awareness or training (see 6.3) to all users on how to identify and potentially mitigate the receipt, sending or installation of malware infected emails, files or programs [the information collected in n) and o) can be used to ensure awareness and training are kept up-to-date];n) implementing procedures to regularly collect information about new malware, such as subscribing to mailing lists or reviewing relevant websites;o) verifying that information relating to malware, such as warning bulletins, comes from qualified and reputable sources (e.g. reliable internet sites or suppliers of malware detection software) and is accurate and informative.Other informationIt is not always possible to install software that protects against malware on some systems (e.g. some industrial control systems). Some forms of malware infect computer operating systems and computer firmware such that common malware controls cannot clean the system and a full reimaging of the operating system software and sometimes the computer firmware is necessary to return to a secure state.",

Updating the list of information resources based on changes in the inventory or when other new or useful resources are found;c) requiring suppliers of information system (including their components) to ensure vulnerability reporting, handling and disclosure, including the requirements in applicable contracts (see 5.20);d) using vulnerability scanning tools suitable for the technologies in use to identify vulnerabilities and to verify whether the patching of vulnerabilities was successful;e) conducting planned, documented and repeatable penetration tests or vulnerability assessments by competent and authorized persons to support the identification of vulnerabilities. Exercising caution as such activities can lead to a compromise of the security of the system;f) tracking the usage of third-party libraries and source code for vulnerabilities. This should beincluded in secure coding (see 8.28).The organization should develop procedures and capabilities to:a) detect the existence of vulnerabilities in its products and services including any external component used in these;b) receive vulnerability reports from internal or external sources.The organization should provide a public point of contact as part of a topic-specific policy on vulnerability disclosure so that researchers and others are able to report issues. The organization should establish vulnerability reporting procedures, online reporting forms and making use of appropriate threat intelligence or information sharing forums. The organization should also consider bug bounty programswhere rewards are offered as an incentive to assist organizations in identifying vulnerabilities in order to appropriately remediate them. The organization should also share information with competent industry bodies or other interested parties.Evaluating technical vulnerabilitiesTo evaluate identified technical vulnerabilities, the following guidance should be considered:a) analyse and verify reports to determine what response and remediation activity is needed;b) once a potential technical vulnerability has been identified, identifying the associated risks and the actions to be taken. Such actions can involve updating vulnerable systems or applying other controls.Taking appropriate measures to address technical vulnerabilitiesA software update management process should be implemented to ensure the most up-to-date approved patches and application updates are installed for all authorized software. If changes are necessary, the original software should be retained and the changes applied to a designated copy. All changes should be fully tested and documented, so that they can be reapplied, if necessary, to future software upgrades. If required, the modifications should be tested and validated by an independent evaluation body.The following guidance should be considered to address technical vulnerabilities:a) taking appropriate and timely action in response to the identification of potential technical vulnerabilities; defining a timeline to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical vulnerabilities;b) depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, carrying out the action according to the controls related to change management (see 8.32) or by following information security incident response procedures (see 5.26);c) only using updates from legitimate sources (which can be internal or external to the organization);d) testing and evaluating updates before they are installed to ensure they are effective and do not result in side effects that cannot be tolerated [i.e. if an update is available, assessing the risks associated with installing the update (the risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared with the risk of installing the update)];e) addressing systems at high risk first;f) develop remediation (typically software updates or patches);g) test to confirm if the remediation or mitigation is effective;h) provide mechanisms to verify the authenticity of remediation;i) if no update is available or the update cannot be installed, considering other controls, such as:1) applying any workaround suggested by the software vendor or other relevant sources;2) turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability;3) adapting or adding access controls (e.g. firewalls) at network borders (see 8.20 to 8.22);4) shielding vulnerable systems, devices or applications from attack through deployment of suitable traffic filters (sometimes called virtual patching);5) increasing monitoring to detect actual attacks;6) raising awareness of the vulnerability.For acquired software, if the vendors regularly release information about security updates for their software and provide a facility to install such updates automatically, the organization should decide whether to use the automatic update or not.Other considerationsAn audit log should be kept for all steps undertaken in technical vulnerability management.The technical vulnerability management process should be regularly monitored and evaluated in order to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency.An effective technical vulnerability management process should be aligned with incident management activities, to communicate data on vulnerabilities to the incident response function and provide technical procedures to be carried out in case an incident occurs.Where the organization uses a cloud service supplied by a third-party cloud service provider, technical vulnerability management of cloud service provider resources should be ensured by the cloud service provider. The cloud service provider's responsibilities for technical vulnerability management should be part of the cloud service agreement and this should include processes for reporting the cloud service provider's actions relating to technical vulnerabilities (see 5.23). For some cloud services, there are respective responsibilities for the cloud service provider and the cloud service customer. For example, the cloud service customer is responsible for vulnerability management of its own assets used for the cloud services.Other informationTechnical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of change management and as such can take advantage of the change management processes and procedures (see 8.32).There is a possibility that an update does not address the problem adequately and has negative side effects. Also, in some cases, uninstalling an update cannot be easily achieved once the update has been applied.If adequate testing of the updates is not possible (e.g. because of costs or lack of resources) a delay in updating can be considered to evaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by other users. The use of ISO/IEC 27031 can be beneficial.Where software patches or updates are produced, the organization can consider providing an automated update process where these updates are installed on affected systems or products without the need for intervention by the customer or the user. If an automated update process is offered, it can allow the customer or user to choose an option to turn off the automatic update or control the timing of the installation of the update.Where the vendor provides an automated update process and the updates can be installed on affected systems or products without the need for intervention, the organization determines if it applies the automated process or not. One reason for not electing for automated update is to retain control over when the update is performed. For example, a software used for a business operation cannot be updated until the operation has completed.A weakness with vulnerability scanning is that it is possible it does not fully account for defence in depth: two countermeasures that are always invoked in sequence can have vulnerabilities that are masked by strengths in the other. The composite countermeasure is not vulnerable, whereas a vulnerability scanner can report that both components are vulnerable. The organization should therefore take care in reviewing and acting on vulnerability reports.Many organizations supply software, systems, products and services not only within the organization but also to interested parties such as customers, partners or other users. These software, systems, products and services can have information security vulnerabilities that affect the security of users.Organizations can release remediation and disclose information about vulnerabilities to users (typically through a public advisory) and provide appropriate information for software vulnerability database services.For more information relating to the management of technical vulnerabilities when using cloud computing, see the ISO/IEC 19086 series and ISO/IEC 27017.ISO/IEC 29147 provides detailed information on receiving vulnerability reports and publishing vulnerability advisories. ISO/IEC 30111 provides detailed information about handling and resolving reported vulnerabilities.",

These records should be securely stored. This can be achieved in various ways, such as configuration databases or configuration templates.Changes to configurations should follow the change management process (see 8.32). Configuration records can contain as relevant:a) up-to-date owner or point of contact information for the asset;b) date of the last change of configuration;c) version of configuration template;d) relation to configurations of other assets. Monitoring configurationsConfigurations should be monitored with a comprehensive set of system management tools (e.g. maintenance utilities, remote support, enterprise management tools, backup and restore software) and should be reviewed on a regular basis to verify configuration settings, evaluate password strengths and assess activities performed. Actual configurations can be compared with the defined target templates. Any deviations should be addressed, either by automatic enforcement of the defined target configuration or by manual analysis of the deviation followed by corrective actions.Other informationDocumentation for systems often records details about the configuration of both hardware and software.System hardening is a typical part of configuration management.Configuration management can be integrated with asset management processes and associated tooling. Automation is usually more effective to manage security configuration (e.g. using infrastructure as code).Configuration templates and targets can be confidential information and should be protected from unauthorized access accordingly.",

These deletion processes should be automated inaccordance with topic-specific policies, when available and applicable. Depending on the sensitivity of information deleted, logs can track or verify that these deletion processes have happened.To avoid the unintentional exposure of sensitive information when equipment is being sent back to vendors, sensitive information should be protected by removing auxiliary storages (e.g. hard disk drives) and memory before equipment leaves the organization's premises.Considering that the secure deletion of some devices (e.g. smartphones) can only be achieved through destruction or using the functions embedded in these devices (e.g. \"restore factory settings\"), the organization should choose the appropriate method according to the classification of information handled by such devices.Control measures described in 7.14 should be applied to physically destroy the storage device and simultaneously delete the information it contains.An official record of information deletion is useful when analysing the cause of a possible information leakage event.Other informationInformation on user data deletion in cloud services can be found in ISO/IEC 27017. Information on deletion of PII can be found in ISO/IEC 27555.",

Data anonymization should consider all the elements of the sensitive information to be effective. As an example, if not considered properly, a person can be identified even if the data that can directly identify that person is anonymised, by the presence of further data which allows the person to be identified indirectly.Additional techniques for data masking include:a) encryption (requiring authorized users to have a key);b) nulling or deleting characters (preventing unauthorized users from seeing full messages);c) varying numbers and dates;d) substitution (changing one value for another to hide sensitive data);e) replacing values with their hash.The following should be considered when implementing data masking techniques:a) not granting all users access to all data, therefore designing queries and masks in order to show only the minimum required data to the user;b) there are cases where some data should not be visible to the user for some records out of a set of data; in this case, designing and implementing a mechanism for obfuscation of data (e.g. if a patient does not want hospital staff to be able to see all of their records, even in case of emergency, then the hospital staff are presented with partially obfuscated data and data can only be accessed by staff with specific roles if it contains useful information for appropriate treatment);c) when data are obfuscated, giving the PII principal the possibility to require that users cannot see if the data are obfuscated (obfuscation of the obfuscation; this is used in health facilities, for example if the patient does not want personnel to see that sensitive information such as pregnancies or results of blood exams has been obfuscated);d) any legal or regulatory requirements (e.g. requiring the masking of payment cards' information during processing or storage).The following should be considered when using data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization:a) level of strength of data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization according to the usage of the processed data;b) access controls to the processed data;c) agreements or restrictions on usage of the processed data;d) prohibiting collating the processed data with other information in order to identify the PII principal;e) keeping track of providing and receiving the processed data.Other informationAnonymization irreversibly alters PII in such a way that the PII principal can no longer be identified directly or indirectly.Pseudonymization replaces the identifying information with an alias. Knowledge of the algorithm (sometimes referred to as the \"additional information\") used to perform the pseudonymization allows for at least some form of identification of the PII principal. Such \"additional information\" should therefore be kept separate and protected.While pseudonymization is therefore weaker than anonymization, pseudonymized datasets can be more useful in statistical research.Data masking is a set of techniques to conceal, substitute or obfuscate sensitive data items. Data masking can be static (when data items are masked in the original database), dynamic (using automation and rules to secure data in real-time) or on-the-fly (with data masked in an application's memory).Hash functions can be used in order to anonymize PII. In order to prevent enumeration attacks, they should always be combined with a salt function.PII in resource identifiers and their attributes [e.g. file names, uniform resource locators (URLs)] should be either avoided or appropriately anonymized.Additional controls concerning the protection of PII in public clouds are given in ISO/IEC 27018.Additional information on de-identification techniques is available in ISO/IEC 20889.",

If that is the case, the organization should implement technology such as data leakage prevention tools or the configuration of existing tools that allow users to view and manipulate data held remotely but prevent copy and paste outside of the organization's control.If data export is required, the data owner should be allowed to approve the export and hold users accountable for their actions.Taking screenshots or photographs of the screen should be addressed through terms and conditions of use, training and auditing.Where data is backed up, care should be taken to ensure sensitive information is protected using measures such as encryption, access control and physical protection of the storage media holding the backup.Data leakage prevention should also be considered to protect against the intelligence actions of an adversary from obtaining confidential or secret information (geopolitical, human, financial, commercial, scientific or any other) which can be of interest for espionage or can be critical for the community. The data leakage prevention actions should be oriented to confuse the adversary's decisions for example by replacing authentic information with false information, either as an independent action or as a response to the adversary's intelligence actions. Examples of these kinds of actions are reverse social engineering or the use of honeypots to attract attackers.Other informationData leakage prevention tools are designed to identify data, monitor data usage and movement, and take actions to prevent data from leaking (e.g. alerting users to their risky behaviour and blocking the transfer of data to portable storage devices).Data leakage prevention inherently involves monitoring personnel's communications and online activities, and by extension external party messages, which raises legal concerns that should be considered prior to deploying data leakage prevention tools. There is a variety of legislation relating to privacy, data protection, employment, interception of data and telecommunications that is applicable to monitoring and data processing in the context of data leakage prevention.Data leakage prevention can be supported by standard security controls, such as topic-specific policies on access control and secure document management (see 5.12 and 5.15).",

This should be combined with a test of the restoration procedures and checked against the restoration time required by the business continuity plan. In the case of critical systems and services, backup measures should cover all systems information, applications and data necessary to recover the complete system in the event of a disaster.When the organization uses a cloud service, backup copies of the organization's information, applications and systems in the cloud service environment should be taken. The organization should determine if and how requirements for backup are fulfilled when using the information backup service provided as part of the cloud service.The retention period for essential business information should be determined, taking into account any requirement for retention of archive copies. The organization should consider the deletion of information (see 8.10) in storage media used for backup once the information's retention period expires and should take into consideration legislation and regulations.Other informationFor further information on storage security including retention consideration, see ISO/IEC 27040.",

The organization should design and implement systems architecture with appropriate redundancy to meet these requirements.Redundancy can be introduced by duplicating information processing facilities in part or in their entirety (i.e. spare components or having two of everything). The organization should plan and implement procedures for the activation of the redundant components and processing facilities. The procedures should establish if the redundant components and processing activities are always activated, or in case of emergency, automatically or manually activated. The redundant components and information processing facilities should ensure the same security level as the primary ones.Mechanisms should be in place to alert the organization to any failure in the information processing facilities, enable executing the planned procedure and allow continued availability while the information processing facilities are repaired or replaced.The organization should consider the following when implementing redundant systems:a) contracting with two or more suppliers of network and critical information processing facilities such as internet service providers;b) using redundant networks;c) using two geographically separate data centres with mirrored systems;d) using physically redundant power supplies or sources;e) using multiple parallel instances of software components, with automatic load balancing between them (between instances in the same data centre or in different data centres);f) having duplicated components in systems (e.g. CPU, hard disks, memories) or in networks (e.g. firewalls, routers, switches).Where applicable, preferably in production mode, redundant information systems should be tested to ensure the failover from one component to another component works as intended.Other informationThere is a strong relationship between redundancy and ICT readiness for business continuity (see 5.30) especially if short recovery times are required. Many of the redundancy measures can be part of the ICT continuity strategies and solutions.The implementation of redundancies can introduce risks to the integrity (e.g. processes of copying data to duplicated components can introduce errors) or confidentiality (e.g. weak security control of duplicated components can lead to compromise) of information and information systems, which need to be considered when designing information systems.Redundancy in information processing facilities does not usually address application unavailability due to faults within an application.With the use of public cloud computing, it is possible to have multiple live versions of information processing facilities, existing in multiple separate physical locations with automatic failover and load balancing between them.Some of the technologies and techniques for providing redundancy and automatic fail-over in the context of cloud services are discussed in ISO/IEC TS 23167.",

This should be documented in a topic-specific policy on logging.Event logs should include for each event, as applicable:a) user IDs;b) system activities;c) dates, times and details of relevant events (e.g. log-on and log-off);d) device identity, system identifier and location;e) network addresses and protocols.The following events should be considered for logging:a) successful and rejected system access attempts;b) successful and rejected data and other resource access attempts;c) changes to system configuration;d) use of privileges;e) use of utility programs and applications;f) files accessed and the type of access, including deletion of important data files;g) alarms raised by the access control system;h) activation and de-activation of security systems, such as anti-virus systems and intrusion detection systems;i) creation, modification or deletion of identities;j) transactions executed by users in applications. In some cases, the applications are a service or product provided or run by a third party.It is important for all systems to have synchronized time sources (see 8.17) as this allows for correlation of logs between systems for analysis, alerting and investigation of an incident.Protection of logsUsers, including those with privileged access rights, should not have permission to delete or de-activate logs of their own activities. They can potentially manipulate the logs on information processing facilities under their direct control. Therefore, it is necessary to protect and review the logs to maintain accountability for the privileged users.Controls should aim to protect against unauthorized changes to log information and operational problems with the logging facility including:a) alterations to the message types that are recorded;b) log files being edited or deleted;c) failure to record events or over-writing of past recorded events if the storage media holding a log file is exceeded.For protection of logs, the use of the following techniques should be considered: cryptographic hashing, recording in an append-only and read-only file, recording in a public transparency file.Some audit logs can be required to be archived because of requirements on data retention or requirements to collect and retain evidence (see 5.28).Where the organization needs to send system or application logs to a vendor to assist with debugging or troubleshooting errors, logs should be de-identified where possible using data masking techniques (see 8.11) for information such as usernames, internet protocol (IP) addresses, hostnames or organization name, before sending to the vendor.Event logs can contain sensitive data and personally identifiable information. Appropriate privacy protection measures should be taken (see 5.34).Log analysisLog analysis should cover the analysis and interpretation of information security events, to help identify unusual activity or anomalous behaviour, which can represent indicators of compromise.Analysis of events should be performed by taking into account:a) the necessary skills for the experts performing the analysis;b) determining the procedure of log analysis;c) the required attributes of each security-related event;d) exceptions identified through the use of predetermined rules [e.g. security information and event management (SIEM) or firewall rules, and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) or malware signatures];e) known behaviour patterns and standard network traffic compared to anomalous activity and behaviour [user and entity behaviour analytics (UEBA)];f) results of trend or pattern analysis (e.g. as a result of using data analytics, big data techniques and specialized analysis tools);g) available threat intelligence.Log analysis should be supported by specific monitoring activities to help identify and analyse anomalous behaviour, which includes:a) reviewing successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources [e.g. domain name system (DNS) servers, web portals and file shares];b) checking DNS logs to identify outbound network connections to malicious servers, such as those associated with botnet command and control servers;c) examining usage reports from service providers (e.g. invoices or service reports) for unusual activity within systems and networks (e.g. by reviewing patterns of activity);d) including event logs of physical monitoring such as entrance and exit to ensure more accurate detection and incident analysis;e) correlating logs to enable efficient and highly accurate analysis.Suspected and actual information security incidents should be identified (e.g. malware infection or probing of firewalls) and be subject to further investigation (e.g. as part of an information security incident management process, see 5.25).Other informationSystem logs often contain a large volume of information, much of which is extraneous to information security monitoring. To help identify significant events for information security monitoring purposes, the use of suitable utility programs or audit tools to perform file interrogation can be considered.Event logging sets the foundation for automated monitoring systems (see 8.16) which are capable of generating consolidated reports and alerts on system security.A SIEM tool or equivalent service can be used to store, correlate, normalize and analyse log information, and to generate alerts. SIEMs tend to require careful configuration to optimize their benefits. Configurations to consider include identification and selection of appropriate log sources, tuning and testing of rules and development of use cases.Public transparency files for the recording of logs are used, for example, in certificate transparency systems. Such files can provide an additional detection mechanism useful for guarding against log tampering.In cloud environments, log management responsibilities can be shared between the cloud service customer and the cloud service provider. Responsibilities vary depending on the type of cloud service being used. Further guidance can be found in ISO/IEC 27017.",

Monitoring records should be maintained for defined retention periods.The following should be considered for inclusion within the monitoring system:a) outbound and inbound network, system and application traffic;b) access to systems, servers, networking equipment, monitoring system, critical applications, etc.;c) critical or admin level system and network configuration files;d) logs from security tools [e.g. antivirus, IDS, intrusion prevention system (IPS), web filters, firewalls, data leakage prevention];e) event logs relating to system and network activity;f) checking that the code being executed is authorized to run in the system and that it has not been tampered with (e.g. by recompilation to add additional unwanted code);g) use of the resources (e.g. CPU, hard disks, memory, bandwidth) and their performance.The organization should establish a baseline of normal behaviour and monitor against this baseline for anomalies. When establishing a baseline, the following should be considered:a) reviewing utilization of systems at normal and peak periods;b) usual time of access, location of access, frequency of access for each user or group of users.The monitoring system should be configured against the established baseline to identify anomalous behaviour, such as:a) unplanned termination of processes or applications;b) activity typically associated with malware or traffic originating from known malicious IP addresses or network domains (e.g. those associated with botnet command and control servers);c) known attack characteristics (e.g. denial of service and buffer overflows);d) unusual system behaviour (e.g. keystroke logging, process injection and deviations in use of standard protocols);e) bottlenecks and overloads (e.g. network queuing, latency levels and network jitter);f) unauthorized access (actual or attempted) to systems or information;g) unauthorized scanning of business applications, systems and networks;h) successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources (e.g. DNS servers, web portals and file systems);i) unusual user and system behaviour in relation to expected behaviour.Continuous monitoring via a monitoring tool should be used. Monitoring should be done in real time or in periodic intervals, subject to organizational need and capabilities. Monitoring tools should include the ability to handle large amounts of data, adapt to a constantly changing threat landscape, and allow for real-time notification. The tools should also be able to recognize specific signatures and data or network or application behaviour patterns.Automated monitoring software should be configured to generate alerts (e.g. via management consoles, email messages or instant messaging systems) based on predefined thresholds. The alerting system should be tuned and trained on the organization's baseline to minimize false positives. Personnel should be dedicated to respond to alerts and should be properly trained to accurately interpret potential incidents. There should be redundant systems and processes in place to receive and respond to alert notifications.Abnormal events should be communicated to relevant parties in order to improve the following activities: auditing, security evaluation, vulnerability scanning and monitoring (see 5.25). Procedures should be in place to respond to positive indicators from the monitoring system in a timely manner, in order to minimize the effect of adverse events (see 5.26) on information security. Procedures should also be established to identify and address false positives including tuning the monitoring software to reduce the number of future false positives.Other informationSecurity monitoring can be enhanced by:a) leveraging threat intelligence systems (see 5.7);b) leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities;c) using blocklists or allowlists;d) undertaking a range of technical security assessments (e.g. vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, cyber-attack simulations and cyber response exercises), and using the results of these assessments to help determine baselines or acceptable behaviour;e) using performance monitoring systems to help establish and detect anomalous behaviour;f) leveraging logs in combination with monitoring systems.Monitoring activities are often conducted using specialist software, such as intrusion detection systems. These can be configured to a baseline of normal, acceptable and expected system and network activities.Monitoring for anomalous communications helps in the identification of botnets (i.e. set of devices under the malicious control of the botnet owner, usually used for mounting distributed denial of service attacks on other computers of other organizations). If the computer is being controlled by an external device, there is a communication between the infected device and the controller. The organization should therefore employ technologies to monitor for anomalous communications and take such action as necessary.",

Software patches should be applied when they can help to remove or reduce information security vulnerabilities (see 8.8 and 8.19).Computer software can rely on externally supplied software and packages (e.g. software programs using modules which are hosted on external sites), which should be monitored and controlled to avoid unauthorized changes, because they can introduce information security vulnerabilities.Vendor supplied software used in operational systems should be maintained at a level supported by the supplier. Over time, software vendors will cease to support older versions of software. The organization should consider the risks of relying on unsupported software. Open source software used in operational systems should be maintained to the latest appropriate release of the software. Over time, open source code can cease to be maintained but is still available in an open source software repository. The organization should also consider the risks of relying on unmaintained open source software when used in operational systems.When suppliers are involved in installing or updating software, physical or logical access should only be given when necessary and with appropriate authorization. The supplier's activities should be monitored (see 5.22).The organization should define and enforce strict rules on which types of software users can install.The principle of least privilege should be applied to software installation on operational systems. The organization should identify what types of software installations are permitted (e.g. updates and security patches to existing software) and what types of installations are prohibited (e.g. software that is only for personal use and software whose pedigree with regard to being potentially malicious is unknown or suspect). These privileges should be granted based on the roles of the users concerned.Other informationNo other information.",

The domains can be chosen based on levels of trust, criticality and sensitivity (e.g. public access domain, desktop domain, server domain, low- and high-risk systems), along organizational units (e.g. human resources, finance, marketing) or some combination (e.g. server domain connecting to multiple organizational units). The segregation can be done using either physically different networks or by using different logical networks.The perimeter of each domain should be well-defined. If access between network domains is allowed, it should be controlled at the perimeter using a gateway (e.g. firewall, filtering router). The criteria forsegregation of networks into domains, and the access allowed through the gateways, should be based on an assessment of the security requirements of each domain. The assessment should be in accordance with the topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.15), access requirements, value and classification of information processed and take account of the relative cost and performance impact of incorporating suitable gateway technology.Wireless networks require special treatment due to the poorly-defined network perimeter. Radio coverage adjustment should be considered for segregation of wireless networks. For sensitive environments, consideration should be made to treat all wireless access as external connections and to segregate this access from internal networks until the access has passed through a gateway in accordance with network controls (see 8.20) before granting access to internal systems. Wireless access network for guests should be segregated from those for personnel if personnel only use controlled user endpoint devices compliant to the organization's topic-specific policies. WiFi for guests should have at least the same restrictions as WiFi for personnel, in order to discourage the use of guest WiFi by personnel.Other informationNetworks often extend beyond organizational boundaries, as business partnerships are formed that require the interconnection or sharing of information processing and networking facilities. Such extensions can increase the risk of unauthorized access to the organization's information systems that use the network, some of which require protection from other network users because of their sensitivity or criticality.",

A topic-specific policy on the use of cryptography is necessary to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of using cryptographic techniques and to avoid inappropriate or incorrect use;b) identifying the required level of protection and the classification of the information and consequently establishing the type, strength and quality of the cryptographic algorithms required;c) the use of cryptography for protection of information held on mobile user endpoint devices or storage media and transmitted over networks to such devices or storage media;d) the approach to key management, including methods to deal with the generation and protection of cryptographic keys and the recovery of encrypted information in the case of lost, compromised or damaged keys;e) roles and responsibilities for:1) the implementation of the rules for the effective use of cryptography;2) the key management, including key generation (see 8.24);f) the standards to be adopted, as well as cryptographic algorithms, cipher strength, cryptographic solutions and usage practices that are approved or required for use in the organization;g) the impact of using encrypted information on controls that rely on content inspection (e.g. malware detection or content filtering).When implementing the organization's rules for effective use of cryptography, the regulations and national restrictions that can apply to the use of cryptographic techniques in different parts of the world should be taken into consideration as well as the issues of trans-border flow of encrypted information (see 5.31).The contents of service level agreements or contracts with external suppliers of cryptographic services (e.g. with a certification authority) should cover issues of liability, reliability of services and response times for the provision of services (see 5.22).Key managementAppropriate key management requires secure processes for generating, storing, archiving, retrieving, distributing, retiring and destroying cryptographic keys.A key management system should be based on an agreed set of standards, procedures and securemethods for:a) generating keys for different cryptographic systems and different applications;b) issuing and obtaining public key certificates;c) distributing keys to intended entities, including how to activate keys when received;d) storing keys, including how authorized users obtain access to keys;e) changing or updating keys including rules on when to change keys and how this will be done;f) dealing with compromised keys;g) revoking keys including how to withdraw or deactivate keys [e.g. when keys have been compromised or when a user leaves an organization (in which case keys should also be archived)];h) recovering keys that are lost or corrupted;i) backing up or archiving keys;j) destroying keys;k) logging and auditing of key management related activities;l) setting activation and deactivation dates for keys so that the keys can only be used for the period of time according to the organization's rules on key management;m) handling legal requests for access to cryptographic keys (e.g. encrypted information can be required to be made available in an unencrypted form as evidence in a court case).All cryptographic keys should be protected against modification and loss. In addition, secret and private keys need protection against unauthorized use as well as disclosure. Equipment used to generate, store and archive keys should be physically protected.In addition to integrity, for many use cases, the authenticity of public keys should also be considered.Other informationThe authenticity of public keys is usually addressed by public key management processes using certificate authorities and public key certificates, but it is also possible to address it by using technologies such as applying manual processes for small number keys.Cryptography can be used to achieve different information security objectives, for example:a) confidentiality: using encryption of information to protect sensitive or critical information, either stored or transmitted;b) integrity or authenticity: using digital signatures or message authentication codes to verify the authenticity or integrity of stored or transmitted sensitive or critical information. Using algorithms for the purpose of file integrity checking;c) non-repudiation: using cryptographic techniques to provide evidence of the occurrence or non- occurrence of an event or action;d) authentication: using cryptographic techniques to authenticate users and other system entities requesting access to or transacting with system users, entities and resources.The ISO/IEC 11770 series provides further information on key management.",

These requirements are usually determined through a risk assessment. The requirements should be developed with the support of information security specialists.Application security requirements can cover a wide range of topics, depending on the purpose of the application.Application security requirements should include, as applicable:a) level of trust in identity of entities [e.g. through authentication (see 5.17, 8.2 and 8.5)];b) identifying the type of information and classification level to be processed by the application;c) need for segregation of access and level of access to data and functions in the application;d) resilience against malicious attacks or unintentional disruptions [e.g. protection against buffer overflow or structured query language (SQL) injections];e) legal, statutory and regulatory requirements in the jurisdiction where the transaction is generated, processed, completed or stored;f) need for privacy associated with all parties involved;g) the protection requirements of any confidential information;h) protection of data while being processed, in transit and at rest;i) need to securely encrypt communications between all involved parties;j) input controls, including integrity checks and input validation;k) automated controls (e.g. approval limits or dual approvals);l) output controls, also considering who can access outputs and its authorization;m) restrictions around content of \"free-text\" fields, as these can lead to uncontrolled storage of confidential data (e.g. personal data);n) requirements derived from the business process, such as transaction logging and monitoring, nonrepudiation requirements;o) requirements mandated by other security controls (e.g. interfaces to logging and monitoring or data leakage detection systems);p) error message handling. Transactional servicesAdditionally, for applications offering transactional services between the organization and a partner, the following should be considered when identifying information security requirements:a) the level of trust each party requires in each other's claimed identity;b) the level of trust required in the integrity of information exchanged or processed and the mechanisms for identification of lack of integrity (e.g. cyclic redundancy check, hashing, digital signatures);c) authorization processes associated with who can approve contents of, issue or sign key transactional documents;d) confidentiality, integrity, proof of dispatch and receipt of key documents and the non-repudiation (e.g. contracts associated with tendering and contract processes);e) the confidentiality and integrity of any transactions (e.g. orders, delivery address details and confirmation of receipts);f) requirements on how long to maintain a transaction confidential;g) insurance and other contractual requirements. Electronic ordering and payment applicationsAdditionally, for applications involving electronic ordering and payment, the following should beconsidered:a) requirements for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of order information;b) the degree of verification appropriate to verify payment information supplied by a customer;c) avoidance of loss or duplication of transaction information;d) storing transaction details outside of any publicly accessible environment (e.g. on a storage platform existing on the organizational intranet, and not retained and exposed on electronic storage media directly accessible from the internet);e) where a trusted authority is used (e.g. for the purposes of issuing and maintaining digital signatures or digital certificates) security is integrated and embedded throughout the entire end- to-end certificate or signature management process.Several of the above considerations can be addressed by the application of cryptography (see 8.24), taking into consideration legal requirements (see 5.31 to 5.36, especially see 5.31 for cryptography legislation).Other informationApplications accessible via networks are subject to a range of network related threats, such as fraudulent activities, contract disputes or disclosure of information to the public; incomplete transmission, mis- routing, unauthorized message alteration, duplication or replay. Therefore, detailed risk assessments and careful determination of controls are indispensable. Controls required often include cryptographic methods for authentication and securing data transfer.Further information on application security can be found in the ISO/IEC 27034 series.",

Security should be designed into all architecture layers (business, data, applications and technology). New technology should be analysed for security risks and the design should be reviewed against known attack patterns.Secure engineering principles provide guidance on user authentication techniques, secure session control and data validation and sanitisation.Secure system engineering principles should include analysis of:a) the full range of security controls required to protect information and systems against identified threats;b) the capabilities of security controls to prevent, detect or respond to security events;c) specific security controls required by particular business processes (e.g. encryption of sensitive information, integrity checking and digitally signing information);d) where and how security controls are to be applied (e.g. by integrating with a security architecture and the technical infrastructure);e) how individual security controls (manual and automated) work together to produce an integratedset of controls.Security engineering principles should take account of:a) the need to integrate with a security architecture;b) technical security infrastructure [e.g. public key infrastructure (PKI), identity and access management (IAM), data leakage prevention and dynamic access management];c) capability of the organization to develop and support the chosen technology;d) cost, time and complexity of meeting security requirements;e) current good practices.Secure system engineering should involve:a) the use of security architecture principles, such as \"security by design\", \"defence in depth\", \"security by default\", \"default deny\", \"fail securely\", \"distrust input from external applications\", \"security in deployment\", \"assume breach\", \"least privilege\", \"usability and manageability\" and \"least functionality\";b) a security-oriented design review to help identify information security vulnerabilities, ensure security controls are specified and meet security requirements;c) documentation and formal acknowledgement of security controls that do not fully meet requirements (e.g. due to overriding safety requirements);d) hardening of systems.The organization should consider \"zero trust\" principles such as:a) assuming the organization's information systems are already breached and thus not be reliant on network perimeter security alone;b) employing a \"never trust and always verify\" approach for access to information systems;c) ensuring that requests to information systems are encrypted end-to-end;d) verifying each request to an information system as if it originated from an open, external network, even if these requests originated internal to the organization (i.e. not automatically trusting anything inside or outside its perimeters);e) using \"least privilege\" and dynamic access control techniques (see 5.15, 5.18 and 8.2). This includes authenticating and authorizing requests for information or to systems based on contextual information such as authentication information (see 5.17), user identities (see 5.16), data about the user endpoint device, and data classification (see 5.12);f) always authenticating requesters and always validating authorization requests to information systems based on information including authentication information (see 5.17) and user identities (5.16), data about the user endpoint device, and data classification (see 5.12), for example enforcing strong authentication (e.g. multi-factor, see 8.5).The established security engineering principles should be applied, where applicable, to outsourced development of information systems through the contracts and other binding agreements between the organization and the supplier to whom the organization outsources. The organization should ensure that suppliers' security engineering practices align with the organization's needs.The security engineering principles and the established engineering procedures should be regularly reviewed to ensure that they are effectively contributing to enhanced standards of security within the engineering process. They should also be regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain up-to- date in terms of combatting any new potential threats and in remaining applicable to advances in the technologies and solutions being applied.Other informationSecure engineering principles can be applied to the design or configuration of a range of techniques, such as:- fault tolerance and other resilience techniques;- segregation (e.g. through virtualization or containerization);- tamper resistance.Secure virtualization techniques can be used to prevent interference between applications running on the same physical device. If a virtual instance of an application is compromised by an attacker, only that instance is affected. The attack has no effect on any other application or data.Tamper resistance techniques can be used to detect tampering of information containers, whether physical (e.g. a burglar alarm) or logical (e.g. a data file). A characteristic of such techniques is that there is a record of the attempt to tamper with the container. In addition, the control can prevent the successful extraction of data through its destruction (e.g. device memory can be deleted).",

A minimum secure baseline should be established and applied. Additionally, such processes and governance should be extended to cover software components from third parties and open source software.The organization should monitor real world threats and up-to-date advice and information on software vulnerabilities to guide the organization's secure coding principles through continual improvement and learning. This can help with ensuring effective secure coding practices are implemented to combat the fast-changing threat landscape.Planning and before codingSecure coding principles should be used both for new developments and in reuse scenarios. These principles should be applied to development activities both within the organization and for products and services supplied by the organization to others. Planning and prerequisites before coding should include:a) organization-specific expectations and approved principles for secure coding to be used for both in-house and outsourced code developments;b) common and historical coding practices and defects that lead to information security vulnerabilities;c) configuring development tools, such as integrated development environments (IDE), to help enforce the creation of secure code;d) following guidance issued by the providers of development tools and execution environments as applicable;e) maintenance and use of updated development tools (e.g. compilers);f) qualification of developers in writing secure code;g) secure design and architecture, including threat modelling;h) secure coding standards and where relevant mandating their use;i) use of controlled environments for development. During codingConsiderations during coding should include:a) secure coding practices specific to the programming languages and techniques being used;b) using secure programming techniques, such as pair programming, refactoring, peer review, security iterations and test-driven development;c) using structured programming techniques;d) documenting code and removing programming defects, which can allow information security vulnerabilities to be exploited;e) prohibiting the use of insecure design techniques (e.g. the use of hard-coded passwords, unapproved code samples and unauthenticated web services).Testing should be conducted during and after development (see 8.29). Static application security testing (SAST) processes can identify security vulnerabilities in software.Before software is made operational, the following should be evaluated:a) attack surface and the principle of least privilege;b) conducting an analysis of the most common programming errors and documenting that these have been mitigated.Review and maintenanceAfter code has been made operational:a) updates should be securely packaged and deployed;b) reported information security vulnerabilities should be handled (see 8.8);c) errors and suspected attacks should be logged and logs regularly reviewed to make adjustments to the code as necessary;d) source code should be protected against unauthorized access and tampering (e.g. by using configuration management tools, which typically provide features such as access control and version control).If using external tools and libraries, the organization should consider:a) ensuring that external libraries are managed (e.g. by maintaining an inventory of libraries used and their versions) and regularly updated with release cycles;b) selection, authorization and reuse of well-vetted components, particularly authentication and cryptographic components;c) the licence, security and history of external components;d) ensuring that software is maintainable, tracked and originates from proven, reputable sources;e) sufficiently long-term availability of development resources and artefacts.Where a software package needs to be modified the following points should be considered:a) the risk of built-in controls and integrity processes being compromised;b) whether to obtain the consent of the vendor;c) the possibility of obtaining the required changes from the vendor as standard program updates;d) the impact if the organization becomes responsible for the future maintenance of the software as a result of changes;e) compatibility with other software in use.Other informationA guiding principle is to ensure security-relevant code is invoked when necessary and is tamper- resistant. Programs installed from compiled binary code also have these properties but only for data held within the application. For interpreted languages, the concept only works when the code is executed on a server that is otherwise inaccessible by the users and processes that use it, and that its data is held in a similarly protected database. For example, the interpreted code can be run on a cloud service where access to the code itself requires administrator privileges. Such administrator access should be protected by security mechanisms such as just-in-time administration principles and strong authentication. If the application owner can access scripts by direct remote access to the server, so in principle can an attacker. Webservers should be configured to prevent directory browsing in such cases.Application code is best designed on the assumption that it is always subject to attack, through error or malicious action. In addition, critical applications can be designed to be tolerant of internal faults. For example, the output from a complex algorithm can be checked to ensure that it lies within safe bounds before the data is used in an application such as a safety or financial critical application. The code that performs the boundary checks is simple and therefore much easier to prove correctness.Some web applications are susceptible to a variety of vulnerabilities that are introduced by poor design and coding, such as database injection and cross-site scripting attacks. In these attacks, requests can be manipulated to abuse the webserver functionality.More information on ICT security evaluation can be found in the ISO/IEC 15408 series.",

Security testing should be an integral part of the testing for systems or components.Security testing should be conducted against a set of requirements, which can be expressed as functional or non-functional. Security testing should include testing of:a) security functions [e.g. user authentication (see 8.5), access restriction (see 8.3) and use of cryptography (see 8.24)];b) secure coding (see 8.28);c) secure configurations (see 8.9, 8.20 and 8.22) including that of operating systems, firewalls and other security components.Test plans should be determined using a set of criteria. The extent of testing should be in proportion to the importance, nature of the system and the potential impact of the change being introduced. The test plan should include:a) detailed schedule of activities and tests;b) inputs and expected outputs under a range of conditions;c) criteria to evaluate the results;d) decision for further actions as necessary.The organization can leverage automated tools, such as code analysis tools or vulnerability scanners, and should verify the remediation of security related defects.For in-house developments, such tests should initially be performed by the development team. Independent acceptance testing should then be undertaken to ensure that the system works as expected and only as expected (see 5.8). The following should be considered:a) performing code review activities as a relevant element for testing for security flaws, including un- anticipated inputs and conditions;b) performing vulnerability scanning to identify insecure configurations and system vulnerabilities;c) performing penetration testing to identify insecure code and design.For outsourced development and purchasing components, an acquisition process should be followed. Contracts with the supplier should address the identified security requirements (see 5.20). Products and services should be evaluated against these criteria before acquisition.Testing should be performed in a test environment that matches the target production environment as closely as possible to ensure that the system does not introduce vulnerabilities to the organization's environment and that the tests are reliable (see 8.31).Other informationMultiple test environments can be established, which can be used for different kinds of testing (e.g. functional and performance testing). These different environments can be virtual, with individual configurations to simulate a variety of operating environments.Testing and monitoring of test environments, tools and technologies also needs to be considered to ensure effective testing. The same considerations apply to monitoring of the monitoring systems deployed in development, test and production settings. Judgement is needed, guided by the sensitivity of the systems and data, to determine how many layers of meta-testing are useful.",

This can be achieved for example through segregation of access rights or through rules that are monitored. In exceptional situations, additional measures such as detailed logging and real-time monitoring should be implemented in order to detect and act on unauthorized changes.Other informationWithout adequate measures and procedures, developers and testers having access to production systems can introduce significant risks (e.g. unwanted modification of files or system environment, system failure, running unauthorized and untested code in production systems, disclosure of confidential data, data integrity and availability issues). There is a need to maintain a known and stable environment in which to perform meaningful testing and to prevent inappropriate developer access to the production environment.Measures and procedures include carefully designed roles in conjunction with implementing segregation of duty requirements and having adequate monitoring processes in place.Development and testing personnel also pose a threat to the confidentiality of production information. Development and testing activities can cause unintended changes to software or information if they share the same computing environment. Separating development, testing and production environments is therefore desirable to reduce the risk of accidental change or unauthorized access to production software and business data (see 8.33 for the protection of test information).In some cases, the distinction between development, test and production environments can be deliberately blurred and testing can be carried out in a development environment or through controlled rollouts to live users or servers (e.g. small population of pilot users). In some cases, product testing can occur through live use of the product inside the organization. Furthermore, to reduce downtime of live deployments, two identical production environments can be supported where only one is live at any one time.Supporting processes for the use of production data in development and testing environments (8.33) are necessary.Organizations can also consider the guidance provided in this section for training environments when conducting end user training.",

Changes to the production environment, especially when transferring software from development to operational environment, can impact on the integrity and availability of applications.Changing software can impact the production environment and vice versa.Good practice includes the testing of ICT components in an environment segregated from both the production and development environments (see 8.31). This provides a means of having control over new software and allowing additional protection of operational information that is used for testing purposes. This should include patches, service packs and other updates.Production environment includes operating systems, databases and middleware platforms. The control should be applied for changes of applications and infrastructures.",
