Where strong authentication and identity verification is required, authentication methodsalternative to passwords, such as digital certificates, smart cards, tokens or biometric means, should beused.Authentication information should be accompanied by additional authentication factors for accessing critical information systems (also known as multi-factor authentication). Using a combination of multiple authentication factors, such as what you know, what you have and what you are, reduces the possibilities for unauthorized accesses. Multi-factor authentication can be combined with other techniques to require additional factors under specific circumstances, based on predefined rules and patterns, such as access from an unusual location, from an unusual device or at an unusual time.Biometric authentication information should be invalidated if it is ever compromised. Biometric authentication can be unavailable depending on the conditions of use (e.g. moisture or aging). To prepare for these issues, biometric authentication should be accompanied with at least one alternative authentication technique.The procedure for logging into a system or application should be designed to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

When establishing a baseline, the following should be considered:a) reviewing utilization of systems at normal and peak periods;b) usual time of access, location of access, frequency of access for each user or group of users.The monitoring system should be configured against the established baseline to identify anomalous behaviour, such as:a) unplanned termination of processes or applications;b) activity typically associated with malware or traffic originating from known malicious IP addresses or network domains (e.g. those associated with botnet command and control servers);c) known attack characteristics (e.g. denial of service and buffer overflows);d) unusual system behaviour (e.g. keystroke logging, process injection and deviations in use of standard protocols);e) bottlenecks and overloads (e.g. network queuing, latency levels and network jitter);f) unauthorized access (actual or attempted) to systems or information;g) unauthorized scanning of business applications, systems and networks;h) successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources (e.g. DNS servers, web portals and file systems);i) unusual user and system behaviour in relation to expected behaviour.Continuous monitoring via a monitoring tool should be used. Monitoring should be done in real time or in periodic intervals, subject to organizational need and capabilities. Monitoring tools should include the ability to handle large amounts of data, adapt to a constantly changing threat landscape, and allow for real-time notification. The tools should also be able to recognize specific signatures and data or network or application behaviour patterns.Automated monitoring software should be configured to generate alerts (e.g. via management consoles, email messages or instant messaging systems) based on predefined thresholds. The alerting system should be tuned and trained on the organization's baseline to minimize false positives. Personnel should be dedicated to respond to alerts and should be properly trained to accurately interpret potential incidents. There should be redundant systems and processes in place to receive and respond to alert notifications.Abnormal events should be communicated to relevant parties in order to improve the following activities: auditing, security evaluation, vulnerability scanning and monitoring (see 5.25). Procedures should be in place to respond to positive indicators from the monitoring system in a timely manner, in order to minimize the effect of adverse events (see 5.26) on information security. Procedures should also be established to identify and address false positives including tuning the monitoring software to reduce the number of future false positives.Other informationSecurity monitoring can be enhanced by:a) leveraging threat intelligence systems (see 5.7);b) leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities;c) using blocklists or allowlists;d) undertaking a range of technical security assessments (e.g. vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, cyber-attack simulations and cyber response exercises), and using the results of these assessments to help determine baselines or acceptable behaviour;e) using performance monitoring systems to help establish and detect anomalous behaviour;f) leveraging logs in combination with monitoring systems.Monitoring activities are often conducted using specialist software, such as intrusion detection systems. These can be configured to a baseline of normal, acceptable and expected system and network activities.Monitoring for anomalous communications helps in the identification of botnets (i.e. set of devices under the malicious control of the botnet owner, usually used for mounting distributed denial of service attacks on other computers of other organizations). If the computer is being controlled by an external device, there is a communication between the infected device and the controller.

The organization should also consider third-party attestations provided by service providers to demonstrate they maintain appropriate security measures.Rules on the use of networks and network services should be formulated and implemented to cover:a) the networks and network services which are allowed to be accessed;b) authentication requirements for accessing various network services;c) authorization procedures for determining who is allowed to access which networks and networked services;d) network management and technological controls and procedures to protect access to network connections and network services;e) the means used to access networks and network services [e.g. use of virtual private network (VPN) or wireless network];f) time, location and other attributes of the user at the time of the access;g) monitoring of the use of network services.The following security features of network services should be considered:a) technology applied for security of network services, such as authentication, encryption and network connection controls;b) technical parameters required for secured connection with the network services in accordance with the security and network connection rules;c) caching (e.g. in a content delivery network) and its parameters that allow users to choose the use of caching in accordance with performance, availability and confidentiality requirements;d) procedures for the network service usage to restrict access to network services or applications, where necessary.Other informationNetwork services include the provision of connections, private network services and managed network security solutions such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems. These services can range from simple unmanaged bandwidth to complex value-added offerings.More guidance on a framework for access management is given in ISO/IEC 29146.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The right to audit should be agreed between the organization and the provider.

The domains can be chosen based on levels of trust, criticality and sensitivity (e.g. public access domain, desktop domain, server domain, low- and high-risk systems), along organizational units (e.g. human resources, finance, marketing) or some combination (e.g. server domain connecting to multiple organizational units). The segregation can be done using either physically different networks or by using different logical networks.The perimeter of each domain should be well-defined. If access between network domains is allowed, it should be controlled at the perimeter using a gateway (e.g. firewall, filtering router). The criteria forsegregation of networks into domains, and the access allowed through the gateways, should be based on an assessment of the security requirements of each domain. The assessment should be in accordance with the topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.15), access requirements, value and classification of information processed and take account of the relative cost and performance impact of incorporating suitable gateway technology.Wireless networks require special treatment due to the poorly-defined network perimeter. Radio coverage adjustment should be considered for segregation of wireless networks. For sensitive environments, consideration should be made to treat all wireless access as external connections and to segregate this access from internal networks until the access has passed through a gateway in accordance with network controls (see 8.20) before granting access to internal systems. Wireless access network for guests should be segregated from those for personnel if personnel only use controlled user endpoint devices compliant to the organization's topic-specific policies. WiFi for guests should have at least the same restrictions as WiFi for personnel, in order to discourage the use of guest WiFi by personnel.Other informationNetworks often extend beyond organizational boundaries, as business partnerships are formed that require the interconnection or sharing of information processing and networking facilities.

Updating the list of information resources based on changes in the inventory or when other new or useful resources are found;c) requiring suppliers of information system (including their components) to ensure vulnerability reporting, handling and disclosure, including the requirements in applicable contracts (see 5.20);d) using vulnerability scanning tools suitable for the technologies in use to identify vulnerabilities and to verify whether the patching of vulnerabilities was successful;e) conducting planned, documented and repeatable penetration tests or vulnerability assessments by competent and authorized persons to support the identification of vulnerabilities. Exercising caution as such activities can lead to a compromise of the security of the system;f) tracking the usage of third-party libraries and source code for vulnerabilities. This should beincluded in secure coding (see 8.28).The organization should develop procedures and capabilities to:a) detect the existence of vulnerabilities in its products and services including any external component used in these;b) receive vulnerability reports from internal or external sources.The organization should provide a public point of contact as part of a topic-specific policy on vulnerability disclosure so that researchers and others are able to report issues. The organization should establish vulnerability reporting procedures, online reporting forms and making use of appropriate threat intelligence or information sharing forums. The organization should also consider bug bounty programswhere rewards are offered as an incentive to assist organizations in identifying vulnerabilities in order to appropriately remediate them. The organization should also share information with competent industry bodies or other interested parties.Evaluating technical vulnerabilitiesTo evaluate identified technical vulnerabilities, the following guidance should be considered:a) analyse and verify reports to determine what response and remediation activity is needed;b) once a potential technical vulnerability has been identified, identifying the associated risks and the actions to be taken. Such actions can involve updating vulnerable systems or applying other controls.Taking appropriate measures to address technical vulnerabilitiesA software update management process should be implemented to ensure the most up-to-date approved patches and application updates are installed for all authorized software. If changes are necessary, the original software should be retained and the changes applied to a designated copy. All changes should be fully tested and documented, so that they can be reapplied, if necessary, to future software upgrades. If required, the modifications should be tested and validated by an independent evaluation body.The following guidance should be considered to address technical vulnerabilities:a) taking appropriate and timely action in response to the identification of potential technical vulnerabilities; defining a timeline to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical vulnerabilities;b) depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, carrying out the action according to the controls related to change management (see 8.32) or by following information security incident response procedures (see 5.26);c) only using updates from legitimate sources (which can be internal or external to the organization);d) testing and evaluating updates before they are installed to ensure they are effective and do not result in side effects that cannot be tolerated [i.e. if an update is available, assessing the risks associated with installing the update (the risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared with the risk of installing the update)];e) addressing systems at high risk first;f) develop remediation (typically software updates or patches);g) test to confirm if the remediation or mitigation is effective;h) provide mechanisms to verify the authenticity of remediation;i) if no update is available or the update cannot be installed, considering other controls, such as:1) applying any workaround suggested by the software vendor or other relevant sources;2) turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability;3) adapting or adding access controls (e.g. firewalls) at network borders (see 8.20 to 8.22);4) shielding vulnerable systems, devices or applications from attack through deployment of suitable traffic filters (sometimes called virtual patching);5) increasing monitoring to detect actual attacks;6) raising awareness of the vulnerability.For acquired software, if the vendors regularly release information about security updates for their software and provide a facility to install such updates automatically, the organization should decide whether to use the automatic update or not.Other considerationsAn audit log should be kept for all steps undertaken in technical vulnerability management.The technical vulnerability management process should be regularly monitored and evaluated in order to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency.An effective technical vulnerability management process should be aligned with incident management activities, to communicate data on vulnerabilities to the incident response function and provide technical procedures to be carried out in case an incident occurs.Where the organization uses a cloud service supplied by a third-party cloud service provider, technical vulnerability management of cloud service provider resources should be ensured by the cloud service provider. The cloud service provider's responsibilities for technical vulnerability management should be part of the cloud service agreement and this should include processes for reporting the cloud service provider's actions relating to technical vulnerabilities (see 5.23). For some cloud services, there are respective responsibilities for the cloud service provider and the cloud service customer. For example, the cloud service customer is responsible for vulnerability management of its own assets used for the cloud services.Other informationTechnical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of change management and as such can take advantage of the change management processes and procedures (see 8.32).There is a possibility that an update does not address the problem adequately and has negative side effects. Also, in some cases, uninstalling an update cannot be easily achieved once the update has been applied.If adequate testing of the updates is not possible (e.g. because of costs or lack of resources) a delay in updating can be considered to evaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by other users. The use of ISO/IEC 27031 can be beneficial.Where software patches or updates are produced, the organization can consider providing an automated update process where these updates are installed on affected systems or products without the need for intervention by the customer or the user. If an automated update process is offered, it can allow the customer or user to choose an option to turn off the automatic update or control the timing of the installation of the update.Where the vendor provides an automated update process and the updates can be installed on affected systems or products without the need for intervention, the organization determines if it applies the automated process or not. One reason for not electing for automated update is to retain control over when the update is performed. For example, a software used for a business operation cannot be updated until the operation has completed.A weakness with vulnerability scanning is that it is possible it does not fully account for defence in depth: two countermeasures that are always invoked in sequence can have vulnerabilities that are masked by strengths in the other. The composite countermeasure is not vulnerable, whereas a vulnerability scanner can report that both components are vulnerable. The organization should therefore take care in reviewing and acting on vulnerability reports.Many organizations supply software, systems, products and services not only within the organization but also to interested parties such as customers, partners or other users. These software, systems, products and services can have information security vulnerabilities that affect the security of users.Organizations can release remediation and disclose information about vulnerabilities to users (typically through a public advisory) and provide appropriate information for software vulnerability database services.For more information relating to the management of technical vulnerabilities when using cloud computing, see the ISO/IEC 19086 series and ISO/IEC 27017.ISO/IEC 29147 provides detailed information on receiving vulnerability reports and publishing vulnerability advisories.

Fire suppression should be performed using the most appropriate substance with regard to the surrounding environment (e.g. gas in confined spaces);b) flooding: installing systems able to detect flooding at an early stage under the floors of areas containing storage media or information processing systems. Water pumps or equivalent means should be readily made available in case flooding occurs;c) electrical surges: adopting systems able to protect both server and client information systems against electrical surges or similar events to minimize the consequences of such events;d) explosives and weapons: performing random inspections for the presence of explosives or weapons on personnel, vehicles or goods entering sensitive information processing facilities.Other informationSafes or other forms of secure storage facilities can protect information stored therein against disasters such as a fire, earthquake, flood or explosion.Organizations can consider the concepts of crime prevention through environmental design when designing the controls to secure their environment and reduce urban threats.

The following should be considered in order to support access restriction requirements:a) not allowing access to sensitive information by unknown user identities or anonymously. Public or anonymous access should only be granted to storage locations that do not contain any sensitive information;b) providing configuration mechanisms to control access to information in systems, applications and services;c) controlling which data can be accessed by a particular user;d) controlling which identities or group of identities have which access, such as read, write, delete and execute;e) providing physical or logical access controls for the isolation of sensitive applications, application data, or systems.Further, dynamic access management techniques and processes to protect sensitive information that has high value to the organization should be considered when the organization:a) needs granular control over who can access such information during what period and in what way;b) wants to share such information with people outside the organization and maintain control over who can access it;c) wants to dynamically manage, in real-time, the use and distribution of such information;d) wants to protect such information against unauthorized changes, copying and distribution (including printing);e) wants to monitor the use of the information;f) wants to record any changes to such information that take place in case a future investigation is required.Dynamic access management techniques should protect information throughout its life cycle (i.e. creation, processing, storage, transmission and disposal), including:a) establishing rules on the management of dynamic access based on specific use cases considering:1) granting access permissions based on identity, device, location or application;2) leveraging the classification scheme in order to determine what information needs to be protected with dynamic access management techniques;b) establishing operational, monitoring and reporting processes and supporting technical infrastructure.Dynamic access management systems should protect information by:a) requiring authentication, appropriate credentials or a certificate to access information;b) restricting access, for example to a specified time frame (e.g. after a given date or until a particular date);c) using encryption to protect information;d) defining the printing permissions for the information;e) recording who accesses the information and how the information is used;f) raising alerts if attempts to misuse the information are detected.Other informationDynamic access management techniques and other dynamic information protection technologies can support the protection of information even when data is shared beyond the originating organization, where traditional access controls cannot be enforced.

Data anonymization should consider all the elements of the sensitive information to be effective. As an example, if not considered properly, a person can be identified even if the data that can directly identify that person is anonymised, by the presence of further data which allows the person to be identified indirectly.Additional techniques for data masking include:a) encryption (requiring authorized users to have a key);b) nulling or deleting characters (preventing unauthorized users from seeing full messages);c) varying numbers and dates;d) substitution (changing one value for another to hide sensitive data);e) replacing values with their hash.The following should be considered when implementing data masking techniques:a) not granting all users access to all data, therefore designing queries and masks in order to show only the minimum required data to the user;b) there are cases where some data should not be visible to the user for some records out of a set of data; in this case, designing and implementing a mechanism for obfuscation of data (e.g. if a patient does not want hospital staff to be able to see all of their records, even in case of emergency, then the hospital staff are presented with partially obfuscated data and data can only be accessed by staff with specific roles if it contains useful information for appropriate treatment);c) when data are obfuscated, giving the PII principal the possibility to require that users cannot see if the data are obfuscated (obfuscation of the obfuscation; this is used in health facilities, for example if the patient does not want personnel to see that sensitive information such as pregnancies or results of blood exams has been obfuscated);d) any legal or regulatory requirements (e.g. requiring the masking of payment cards' information during processing or storage).The following should be considered when using data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization:a) level of strength of data masking, pseudonymization or anonymization according to the usage of the processed data;b) access controls to the processed data;c) agreements or restrictions on usage of the processed data;d) prohibiting collating the processed data with other information in order to identify the PII principal;e) keeping track of providing and receiving the processed data.Other informationAnonymization irreversibly alters PII in such a way that the PII principal can no longer be identified directly or indirectly.Pseudonymization replaces the identifying information with an alias. Knowledge of the algorithm (sometimes referred to as the \"additional information\") used to perform the pseudonymization allows for at least some form of identification of the PII principal. Such \"additional information\" should therefore be kept separate and protected.While pseudonymization is therefore weaker than anonymization, pseudonymized datasets can be more useful in statistical research.Data masking is a set of techniques to conceal, substitute or obfuscate sensitive data items. Data masking can be static (when data items are masked in the original database), dynamic (using automation and rules to secure data in real-time) or on-the-fly (with data masked in an application's memory).Hash functions can be used in order to anonymize PII. In order to prevent enumeration attacks, they should always be combined with a salt function.PII in resource identifiers and their attributes [e.g. file names, uniform resource locators (URLs)] should be either avoided or appropriately anonymized.Additional controls concerning the protection of PII in public clouds are given in ISO/IEC 27018.Additional information on de-identification techniques is available in ISO/IEC 20889.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "a) encryption; b) nulling or deleting characters; c) varying numbers and dates; d) substitution; e) replacing values with their hash."}]}

Updating the list of information resources based on changes in the inventory or when other new or useful resources are found;c) requiring suppliers of information system (including their components) to ensure vulnerability reporting, handling and disclosure, including the requirements in applicable contracts (see 5.20);d) using vulnerability scanning tools suitable for the technologies in use to identify vulnerabilities and to verify whether the patching of vulnerabilities was successful;e) conducting planned, documented and repeatable penetration tests or vulnerability assessments by competent and authorized persons to support the identification of vulnerabilities. Exercising caution as such activities can lead to a compromise of the security of the system;f) tracking the usage of third-party libraries and source code for vulnerabilities. This should beincluded in secure coding (see 8.28).The organization should develop procedures and capabilities to:a) detect the existence of vulnerabilities in its products and services including any external component used in these;b) receive vulnerability reports from internal or external sources.The organization should provide a public point of contact as part of a topic-specific policy on vulnerability disclosure so that researchers and others are able to report issues. The organization should establish vulnerability reporting procedures, online reporting forms and making use of appropriate threat intelligence or information sharing forums. The organization should also consider bug bounty programswhere rewards are offered as an incentive to assist organizations in identifying vulnerabilities in order to appropriately remediate them. The organization should also share information with competent industry bodies or other interested parties.Evaluating technical vulnerabilitiesTo evaluate identified technical vulnerabilities, the following guidance should be considered:a) analyse and verify reports to determine what response and remediation activity is needed;b) once a potential technical vulnerability has been identified, identifying the associated risks and the actions to be taken. Such actions can involve updating vulnerable systems or applying other controls.Taking appropriate measures to address technical vulnerabilitiesA software update management process should be implemented to ensure the most up-to-date approved patches and application updates are installed for all authorized software. If changes are necessary, the original software should be retained and the changes applied to a designated copy. All changes should be fully tested and documented, so that they can be reapplied, if necessary, to future software upgrades. If required, the modifications should be tested and validated by an independent evaluation body.The following guidance should be considered to address technical vulnerabilities:a) taking appropriate and timely action in response to the identification of potential technical vulnerabilities; defining a timeline to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical vulnerabilities;b) depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, carrying out the action according to the controls related to change management (see 8.32) or by following information security incident response procedures (see 5.26);c) only using updates from legitimate sources (which can be internal or external to the organization);d) testing and evaluating updates before they are installed to ensure they are effective and do not result in side effects that cannot be tolerated [i.e. if an update is available, assessing the risks associated with installing the update (the risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared with the risk of installing the update)];e) addressing systems at high risk first;f) develop remediation (typically software updates or patches);g) test to confirm if the remediation or mitigation is effective;h) provide mechanisms to verify the authenticity of remediation;i) if no update is available or the update cannot be installed, considering other controls, such as:1) applying any workaround suggested by the software vendor or other relevant sources;2) turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability;3) adapting or adding access controls (e.g. firewalls) at network borders (see 8.20 to 8.22);4) shielding vulnerable systems, devices or applications from attack through deployment of suitable traffic filters (sometimes called virtual patching);5) increasing monitoring to detect actual attacks;6) raising awareness of the vulnerability.For acquired software, if the vendors regularly release information about security updates for their software and provide a facility to install such updates automatically, the organization should decide whether to use the automatic update or not.Other considerationsAn audit log should be kept for all steps undertaken in technical vulnerability management.The technical vulnerability management process should be regularly monitored and evaluated in order to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency.An effective technical vulnerability management process should be aligned with incident management activities, to communicate data on vulnerabilities to the incident response function and provide technical procedures to be carried out in case an incident occurs.Where the organization uses a cloud service supplied by a third-party cloud service provider, technical vulnerability management of cloud service provider resources should be ensured by the cloud service provider. The cloud service provider's responsibilities for technical vulnerability management should be part of the cloud service agreement and this should include processes for reporting the cloud service provider's actions relating to technical vulnerabilities (see 5.23). For some cloud services, there are respective responsibilities for the cloud service provider and the cloud service customer. For example, the cloud service customer is responsible for vulnerability management of its own assets used for the cloud services.Other informationTechnical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of change management and as such can take advantage of the change management processes and procedures (see 8.32).There is a possibility that an update does not address the problem adequately and has negative side effects. Also, in some cases, uninstalling an update cannot be easily achieved once the update has been applied.If adequate testing of the updates is not possible (e.g. because of costs or lack of resources) a delay in updating can be considered to evaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by other users. The use of ISO/IEC 27031 can be beneficial.Where software patches or updates are produced, the organization can consider providing an automated update process where these updates are installed on affected systems or products without the need for intervention by the customer or the user. If an automated update process is offered, it can allow the customer or user to choose an option to turn off the automatic update or control the timing of the installation of the update.Where the vendor provides an automated update process and the updates can be installed on affected systems or products without the need for intervention, the organization determines if it applies the automated process or not. One reason for not electing for automated update is to retain control over when the update is performed. For example, a software used for a business operation cannot be updated until the operation has completed.A weakness with vulnerability scanning is that it is possible it does not fully account for defence in depth: two countermeasures that are always invoked in sequence can have vulnerabilities that are masked by strengths in the other. The composite countermeasure is not vulnerable, whereas a vulnerability scanner can report that both components are vulnerable. The organization should therefore take care in reviewing and acting on vulnerability reports.Many organizations supply software, systems, products and services not only within the organization but also to interested parties such as customers, partners or other users. These software, systems, products and services can have information security vulnerabilities that affect the security of users.Organizations can release remediation and disclose information about vulnerabilities to users (typically through a public advisory) and provide appropriate information for software vulnerability database services.For more information relating to the management of technical vulnerabilities when using cloud computing, see the ISO/IEC 19086 series and ISO/IEC 27017.ISO/IEC 29147 provides detailed information on receiving vulnerability reports and publishing vulnerability advisories.

The domains can be chosen based on levels of trust, criticality and sensitivity (e.g. public access domain, desktop domain, server domain, low- and high-risk systems), along organizational units (e.g. human resources, finance, marketing) or some combination (e.g. server domain connecting to multiple organizational units). The segregation can be done using either physically different networks or by using different logical networks.The perimeter of each domain should be well-defined. If access between network domains is allowed, it should be controlled at the perimeter using a gateway (e.g. firewall, filtering router). The criteria forsegregation of networks into domains, and the access allowed through the gateways, should be based on an assessment of the security requirements of each domain. The assessment should be in accordance with the topic-specific policy on access control (see 5.15), access requirements, value and classification of information processed and take account of the relative cost and performance impact of incorporating suitable gateway technology.Wireless networks require special treatment due to the poorly-defined network perimeter. Radio coverage adjustment should be considered for segregation of wireless networks. For sensitive environments, consideration should be made to treat all wireless access as external connections and to segregate this access from internal networks until the access has passed through a gateway in accordance with network controls (see 8.20) before granting access to internal systems. Wireless access network for guests should be segregated from those for personnel if personnel only use controlled user endpoint devices compliant to the organization's topic-specific policies. WiFi for guests should have at least the same restrictions as WiFi for personnel, in order to discourage the use of guest WiFi by personnel.Other informationNetworks often extend beyond organizational boundaries, as business partnerships are formed that require the interconnection or sharing of information processing and networking facilities. Such extensions can increase the risk of unauthorized access to the organization's information systems that use the network, some of which require protection from other network users because of their sensitivity or criticality.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Wireless networks require special treatment due to the poorly-defined network perimeter.

These requirements are usually determined through a risk assessment. The requirements should be developed with the support of information security specialists.Application security requirements can cover a wide range of topics, depending on the purpose of the application.Application security requirements should include, as applicable:a) level of trust in identity of entities [e.g. through authentication (see 5.17, 8.2 and 8.5)];b) identifying the type of information and classification level to be processed by the application;c) need for segregation of access and level of access to data and functions in the application;d) resilience against malicious attacks or unintentional disruptions [e.g. protection against buffer overflow or structured query language (SQL) injections];e) legal, statutory and regulatory requirements in the jurisdiction where the transaction is generated, processed, completed or stored;f) need for privacy associated with all parties involved;g) the protection requirements of any confidential information;h) protection of data while being processed, in transit and at rest;i) need to securely encrypt communications between all involved parties;j) input controls, including integrity checks and input validation;k) automated controls (e.g. approval limits or dual approvals);l) output controls, also considering who can access outputs and its authorization;m) restrictions around content of \"free-text\" fields, as these can lead to uncontrolled storage of confidential data (e.g. personal data);n) requirements derived from the business process, such as transaction logging and monitoring, nonrepudiation requirements;o) requirements mandated by other security controls (e.g. interfaces to logging and monitoring or data leakage detection systems);p) error message handling. Transactional servicesAdditionally, for applications offering transactional services between the organization and a partner, the following should be considered when identifying information security requirements:a) the level of trust each party requires in each other's claimed identity;b) the level of trust required in the integrity of information exchanged or processed and the mechanisms for identification of lack of integrity (e.g. cyclic redundancy check, hashing, digital signatures);c) authorization processes associated with who can approve contents of, issue or sign key transactional documents;d) confidentiality, integrity, proof of dispatch and receipt of key documents and the non-repudiation (e.g. contracts associated with tendering and contract processes);e) the confidentiality and integrity of any transactions (e.g. orders, delivery address details and confirmation of receipts);f) requirements on how long to maintain a transaction confidential;g) insurance and other contractual requirements. Electronic ordering and payment applicationsAdditionally, for applications involving electronic ordering and payment, the following should beconsidered:a) requirements for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of order information;b) the degree of verification appropriate to verify payment information supplied by a customer;c) avoidance of loss or duplication of transaction information;d) storing transaction details outside of any publicly accessible environment (e.g. on a storage platform existing on the organizational intranet, and not retained and exposed on electronic storage media directly accessible from the internet);e) where a trusted authority is used (e.g. for the purposes of issuing and maintaining digital signatures or digital certificates) security is integrated and embedded throughout the entire end- to-end certificate or signature management process.Several of the above considerations can be addressed by the application of cryptography (see 8.24), taking into consideration legal requirements (see 5.31 to 5.36, especially see 5.31 for cryptography legislation).Other informationApplications accessible via networks are subject to a range of network related threats, such as fraudulent activities, contract disputes or disclosure of information to the public; incomplete transmission, mis- routing, unauthorized message alteration, duplication or replay. Therefore, detailed risk assessments and careful determination of controls are indispensable.

Use of malware detection and repair software alone is not usually adequate. The following guidance should be considered:a) implementing rules and controls that prevent or detect the use of unauthorized software [e.g. application allowlisting (i.e. using a list providing allowed applications)] (see 8.19 and 8.32);b) implementing controls that prevent or detect the use of known or suspected malicious websites (e.g. blocklisting);c) reducing vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malware [e.g. through technical vulnerability management (see 8.8 and 8.19)];d) conducting regular automated validation of the software and data content of systems, especially for systems supporting critical business processes; investigating the presence of any unapproved files or unauthorized amendments;e) establishing protective measures against risks associated with obtaining files and software either from or via external networks or on any other medium;f) installing and regularly updating malware detection and repair software to scan computers and electronic storage media.

Rules, procedures and agreements to protect information in transit should reflect the classification of the information involved. Where information is transferred between the organization and third parties, transfer agreements (including recipient authentication) should be established and maintained to protect information in all forms in transit (see 5.10).Information transfer can happen through electronic transfer, physical storage media transfer and verbal transfer.For all types of information transfer, rules, procedures and agreements should include:a) controls designed to protect transferred information from interception, unauthorized access, copying, modification, misrouting, destruction and denial of service, including levels of access control commensurate with the classification of the information involved and any special controls that are required to protect sensitive information, such as use of cryptographic techniques (see 8.24);b) controls to ensure traceability and non-repudiation, including maintaining a chain of custody for information while in transit;c) identification of appropriate contacts related to the transfer including information owners, risk owners, security officers and information custodians, as applicable;d) responsibilities and liabilities in the event of information security incidents, such as loss of physical storage media or data;e) use of an agreed labelling system for sensitive or critical information, ensuring that the meaning of the labels is immediately understood and that the information is appropriately protected (see 5.13);f) reliability and availability of the transfer service;g) the topic-specific policy or guidelines on acceptable use of information transfer facilities (see 5.10);h) retention and disposal guidelines for all business records, including messages;Local legislation and regulations can exist regarding retention and disposal of business records.i) the consideration of any other relevant legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements (see 5.31, 5.32, 5.33, 5.34) related to transfer of information (e.g. requirements for electronic signatures).Electronic transferRules, procedures and agreements should also consider the following items when using electronic communication facilities for information transfer:a) detection of and protection against malware that can be transmitted through the use of electronic communications (see 8.7);b) protection of communicated sensitive electronic information that is in the form of an attachment;c) prevention against sending documents and messages in communications to the wrong address or number;d) obtaining approval prior to using external public services such as instant messaging, social networking, file sharing or cloud storage;e) stronger levels of authentication when transferring information via publicly accessible networks;f) restrictions associated with electronic communication facilities (e.g. preventing automatic forwarding of electronic mail to external mail addresses);g) advising personnel and other interested parties not to send short message service (SMS) or instant messages with critical information since these can be read in public places (and therefore by unauthorized persons) or stored in devices not adequately protected;h) advising personnel and other interested parties about the problems of using fax machines or services, namely:1) unauthorized access to built-in message stores to retrieve messages;    2) deliberate or accidental programming of machines to send messages to specific numbers. Physical storage media transferWhen transferring physical storage media (including paper), rules, procedures and agreements should also include:a) responsibilities for controlling and notifying transmission, dispatch and receipt;b) ensuring correct addressing and transportation of the message;c) packaging that protects the contents from any physical damage likely to arise during transit and in accordance with any manufacturers' specifications, for example protecting against any environmental factors that can reduce the effectiveness of restoring storage media such as exposure to heat, moisture or electromagnetic fields; using minimum technical standards for packaging and transmission (e.g. the use of opaque envelopes);d) a list of authorized reliable couriers agreed by management;e) courier identification standards;f) depending on the classification level of the information in the storage media to be transported, use tamper evident or tamper-resistant controls (e.g. bags, containers);g) procedures to verify the identification of couriers;h) approved list of third parties providing transportation or courier services depending on the classification of the information;i) keeping logs for identifying the content of the storage media, the protection applied as well as recording the list of authorised recipients, the times of transfer to the transit custodians and receipt at the destination.Verbal transferTo protect verbal transfer of information, personnel and other interested parties should be reminded that they should:a) not have confidential verbal conversations in public places or over insecure communication channels since these can be overheard by unauthorized persons;b) not leave messages containing confidential information on answering machines or voice messages since these can be replayed by unauthorized persons, stored on communal systems or stored incorrectly as a result of misdialling;c) be screened to the appropriate level to listen to the conversation;d) ensure that appropriate room controls are implemented (e.g. sound-proofing, closed door);e) begin any sensitive conversations with a disclaimer so those present know the classification level and any handling requirements of what they are about to hear.Other informationNo other information.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Key considerations include malware protection, encryption, and stronger authentication for public network transfers."}]}

Security should be designed into all architecture layers (business, data, applications and technology). New technology should be analysed for security risks and the design should be reviewed against known attack patterns.Secure engineering principles provide guidance on user authentication techniques, secure session control and data validation and sanitisation.Secure system engineering principles should include analysis of:a) the full range of security controls required to protect information and systems against identified threats;b) the capabilities of security controls to prevent, detect or respond to security events;c) specific security controls required by particular business processes (e.g. encryption of sensitive information, integrity checking and digitally signing information);d) where and how security controls are to be applied (e.g. by integrating with a security architecture and the technical infrastructure);e) how individual security controls (manual and automated) work together to produce an integratedset of controls.Security engineering principles should take account of:a) the need to integrate with a security architecture;b) technical security infrastructure [e.g. public key infrastructure (PKI), identity and access management (IAM), data leakage prevention and dynamic access management];c) capability of the organization to develop and support the chosen technology;d) cost, time and complexity of meeting security requirements;e) current good practices.Secure system engineering should involve:a) the use of security architecture principles, such as \"security by design\", \"defence in depth\", \"security by default\", \"default deny\", \"fail securely\", \"distrust input from external applications\", \"security in deployment\", \"assume breach\", \"least privilege\", \"usability and manageability\" and \"least functionality\";b) a security-oriented design review to help identify information security vulnerabilities, ensure security controls are specified and meet security requirements;c) documentation and formal acknowledgement of security controls that do not fully meet requirements (e.g. due to overriding safety requirements);d) hardening of systems.The organization should consider \"zero trust\" principles such as:a) assuming the organization's information systems are already breached and thus not be reliant on network perimeter security alone;b) employing a \"never trust and always verify\" approach for access to information systems;c) ensuring that requests to information systems are encrypted end-to-end;d) verifying each request to an information system as if it originated from an open, external network, even if these requests originated internal to the organization (i.e. not automatically trusting anything inside or outside its perimeters);e) using \"least privilege\" and dynamic access control techniques (see 5.15, 5.18 and 8.2). This includes authenticating and authorizing requests for information or to systems based on contextual information such as authentication information (see 5.17), user identities (see 5.16), data about the user endpoint device, and data classification (see 5.12);f) always authenticating requesters and always validating authorization requests to information systems based on information including authentication information (see 5.17) and user identities (5.16), data about the user endpoint device, and data classification (see 5.12), for example enforcing strong authentication (e.g. multi-factor, see 8.5).The established security engineering principles should be applied, where applicable, to outsourced development of information systems through the contracts and other binding agreements between the organization and the supplier to whom the organization outsources. The organization should ensure that suppliers' security engineering practices align with the organization's needs.The security engineering principles and the established engineering procedures should be regularly reviewed to ensure that they are effectively contributing to enhanced standards of security within the engineering process. They should also be regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain up-to- date in terms of combatting any new potential threats and in remaining applicable to advances in the technologies and solutions being applied.Other informationSecure engineering principles can be applied to the design or configuration of a range of techniques, such as:- fault tolerance and other resilience techniques;- segregation (e.g. through virtualization or containerization);- tamper resistance.Secure virtualization techniques can be used to prevent interference between applications running on the same physical device. If a virtual instance of an application is compromised by an attacker, only that instance is affected. The attack has no effect on any other application or data.Tamper resistance techniques can be used to detect tampering of information containers, whether physical (e.g. a burglar alarm) or logical (e.g. a data file). A characteristic of such techniques is that there is a record of the attempt to tamper with the container. In addition, the control can prevent the successful extraction of data through its destruction (e.g. device memory can be deleted).\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tamper resistance techniques can be used to detect tampering of information containers, whether physical (e.g. a burglar alarm) or logical (e.g. a data file).

Security testing should be an integral part of the testing for systems or components.Security testing should be conducted against a set of requirements, which can be expressed as functional or non-functional. Security testing should include testing of:a) security functions [e.g. user authentication (see 8.5), access restriction (see 8.3) and use of cryptography (see 8.24)];b) secure coding (see 8.28);c) secure configurations (see 8.9, 8.20 and 8.22) including that of operating systems, firewalls and other security components.Test plans should be determined using a set of criteria. The extent of testing should be in proportion to the importance, nature of the system and the potential impact of the change being introduced. The test plan should include:a) detailed schedule of activities and tests;b) inputs and expected outputs under a range of conditions;c) criteria to evaluate the results;d) decision for further actions as necessary.The organization can leverage automated tools, such as code analysis tools or vulnerability scanners, and should verify the remediation of security related defects.For in-house developments, such tests should initially be performed by the development team. Independent acceptance testing should then be undertaken to ensure that the system works as expected and only as expected (see 5.8). The following should be considered:a) performing code review activities as a relevant element for testing for security flaws, including un- anticipated inputs and conditions;b) performing vulnerability scanning to identify insecure configurations and system vulnerabilities;c) performing penetration testing to identify insecure code and design.For outsourced development and purchasing components, an acquisition process should be followed. Contracts with the supplier should address the identified security requirements (see 5.20). Products and services should be evaluated against these criteria before acquisition.Testing should be performed in a test environment that matches the target production environment as closely as possible to ensure that the system does not introduce vulnerabilities to the organization's environment and that the tests are reliable (see 8.31).Other informationMultiple test environments can be established, which can be used for different kinds of testing (e.g. functional and performance testing). These different environments can be virtual, with individual configurations to simulate a variety of operating environments.Testing and monitoring of test environments, tools and technologies also needs to be considered to ensure effective testing.

Updating the list of information resources based on changes in the inventory or when other new or useful resources are found;c) requiring suppliers of information system (including their components) to ensure vulnerability reporting, handling and disclosure, including the requirements in applicable contracts (see 5.20);d) using vulnerability scanning tools suitable for the technologies in use to identify vulnerabilities and to verify whether the patching of vulnerabilities was successful;e) conducting planned, documented and repeatable penetration tests or vulnerability assessments by competent and authorized persons to support the identification of vulnerabilities. Exercising caution as such activities can lead to a compromise of the security of the system;f) tracking the usage of third-party libraries and source code for vulnerabilities. This should beincluded in secure coding (see 8.28).The organization should develop procedures and capabilities to:a) detect the existence of vulnerabilities in its products and services including any external component used in these;b) receive vulnerability reports from internal or external sources.The organization should provide a public point of contact as part of a topic-specific policy on vulnerability disclosure so that researchers and others are able to report issues. The organization should establish vulnerability reporting procedures, online reporting forms and making use of appropriate threat intelligence or information sharing forums. The organization should also consider bug bounty programswhere rewards are offered as an incentive to assist organizations in identifying vulnerabilities in order to appropriately remediate them. The organization should also share information with competent industry bodies or other interested parties.Evaluating technical vulnerabilitiesTo evaluate identified technical vulnerabilities, the following guidance should be considered:a) analyse and verify reports to determine what response and remediation activity is needed;b) once a potential technical vulnerability has been identified, identifying the associated risks and the actions to be taken. Such actions can involve updating vulnerable systems or applying other controls.Taking appropriate measures to address technical vulnerabilitiesA software update management process should be implemented to ensure the most up-to-date approved patches and application updates are installed for all authorized software. If changes are necessary, the original software should be retained and the changes applied to a designated copy. All changes should be fully tested and documented, so that they can be reapplied, if necessary, to future software upgrades. If required, the modifications should be tested and validated by an independent evaluation body.The following guidance should be considered to address technical vulnerabilities:a) taking appropriate and timely action in response to the identification of potential technical vulnerabilities; defining a timeline to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical vulnerabilities;b) depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, carrying out the action according to the controls related to change management (see 8.32) or by following information security incident response procedures (see 5.26);c) only using updates from legitimate sources (which can be internal or external to the organization);d) testing and evaluating updates before they are installed to ensure they are effective and do not result in side effects that cannot be tolerated [i.e. if an update is available, assessing the risks associated with installing the update (the risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared with the risk of installing the update)];e) addressing systems at high risk first;f) develop remediation (typically software updates or patches);g) test to confirm if the remediation or mitigation is effective;h) provide mechanisms to verify the authenticity of remediation;i) if no update is available or the update cannot be installed, considering other controls, such as:1) applying any workaround suggested by the software vendor or other relevant sources;2) turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability;3) adapting or adding access controls (e.g. firewalls) at network borders (see 8.20 to 8.22);4) shielding vulnerable systems, devices or applications from attack through deployment of suitable traffic filters (sometimes called virtual patching);5) increasing monitoring to detect actual attacks;6) raising awareness of the vulnerability.For acquired software, if the vendors regularly release information about security updates for their software and provide a facility to install such updates automatically, the organization should decide whether to use the automatic update or not.Other considerationsAn audit log should be kept for all steps undertaken in technical vulnerability management.The technical vulnerability management process should be regularly monitored and evaluated in order to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency.An effective technical vulnerability management process should be aligned with incident management activities, to communicate data on vulnerabilities to the incident response function and provide technical procedures to be carried out in case an incident occurs.Where the organization uses a cloud service supplied by a third-party cloud service provider, technical vulnerability management of cloud service provider resources should be ensured by the cloud service provider. The cloud service provider's responsibilities for technical vulnerability management should be part of the cloud service agreement and this should include processes for reporting the cloud service provider's actions relating to technical vulnerabilities (see 5.23). For some cloud services, there are respective responsibilities for the cloud service provider and the cloud service customer. For example, the cloud service customer is responsible for vulnerability management of its own assets used for the cloud services.Other informationTechnical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of change management and as such can take advantage of the change management processes and procedures (see 8.32).There is a possibility that an update does not address the problem adequately and has negative side effects. Also, in some cases, uninstalling an update cannot be easily achieved once the update has been applied.If adequate testing of the updates is not possible (e.g. because of costs or lack of resources) a delay in updating can be considered to evaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by other users. The use of ISO/IEC 27031 can be beneficial.Where software patches or updates are produced, the organization can consider providing an automated update process where these updates are installed on affected systems or products without the need for intervention by the customer or the user. If an automated update process is offered, it can allow the customer or user to choose an option to turn off the automatic update or control the timing of the installation of the update.Where the vendor provides an automated update process and the updates can be installed on affected systems or products without the need for intervention, the organization determines if it applies the automated process or not. One reason for not electing for automated update is to retain control over when the update is performed. For example, a software used for a business operation cannot be updated until the operation has completed.A weakness with vulnerability scanning is that it is possible it does not fully account for defence in depth: two countermeasures that are always invoked in sequence can have vulnerabilities that are masked by strengths in the other. The composite countermeasure is not vulnerable, whereas a vulnerability scanner can report that both components are vulnerable. The organization should therefore take care in reviewing and acting on vulnerability reports.Many organizations supply software, systems, products and services not only within the organization but also to interested parties such as customers, partners or other users. These software, systems, products and services can have information security vulnerabilities that affect the security of users.Organizations can release remediation and disclose information about vulnerabilities to users (typically through a public advisory) and provide appropriate information for software vulnerability database services.For more information relating to the management of technical vulnerabilities when using cloud computing, see the ISO/IEC 19086 series and ISO/IEC 27017.ISO/IEC 29147 provides detailed information on receiving vulnerability reports and publishing vulnerability advisories. ISO/IEC 30111 provides detailed information about handling and resolving reported vulnerabilities.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Organizations should ensure cloud service providers manage technical vulnerabilities and include such responsibilities in service agreements.

Where strong authentication and identity verification is required, authentication methodsalternative to passwords, such as digital certificates, smart cards, tokens or biometric means, should beused.Authentication information should be accompanied by additional authentication factors for accessing critical information systems (also known as multi-factor authentication). Using a combination of multiple authentication factors, such as what you know, what you have and what you are, reduces the possibilities for unauthorized accesses. Multi-factor authentication can be combined with other techniques to require additional factors under specific circumstances, based on predefined rules and patterns, such as access from an unusual location, from an unusual device or at an unusual time.Biometric authentication information should be invalidated if it is ever compromised. Biometric authentication can be unavailable depending on the conditions of use (e.g. moisture or aging). To prepare for these issues, biometric authentication should be accompanied with at least one alternative authentication technique.The procedure for logging into a system or application should be designed to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. Log-on procedures and technologies should be implemented considering the following:a) not displaying sensitive system or application information until the log-on process has been successfully completed in order to avoid providing an unauthorized user with any unnecessary assistance;b) displaying a general notice warning that the system or the application or the service should only be accessed by authorized users;c) not providing help messages during the log-on procedure that would aid an unauthorized user (e.g. if an error condition arises, the system should not indicate which part of the data is correct or incorrect);d) validating the log-on information only on completion of all input data;e) protecting against brute force log-on attempts on usernames and passwords [e.g. using completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart (CAPTCHA), requiring password reset after a predefined number of failed attempts or blocking the user after a maximum number of errors];f) logging unsuccessful and successful attempts;g) raising a security event if a potential attempted or successful breach of log-on controls is detected (e.g. sending an alert to the user and the organization's system administrators when a certain number of wrong password attempts has been reached);h) displaying or sending the following information on a separate channel on completion of a successfullog-on:1) date and time of the previous successful log-on;2) details of any unsuccessful log-on attempts since the last successful log-on;i) not displaying a password in clear text when it is being entered; in some cases, it can be required to de-activate this functionality in order to facilitate user log-on (e.g. for accessibility reasons or to avoid blocking users because of repeated errors);j) not transmitting passwords in clear text over a network to avoid being captured by a network \"sniffer\" program;k) terminating inactive sessions after a defined period of inactivity, especially in high risk locations such as public or external areas outside the organization's security management or on user endpoint devices;l) restricting connection duration times to provide additional security for high-risk applications and reduce the window of opportunity for unauthorized access.Other informationAdditional information on entity authentication assurance can be found is ISO/IEC 29115.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Passwords should not be transmitted in clear text over a network to avoid being captured by a network 'sniffer' program."}]}

Use of malware detection and repair software alone is not usually adequate. The following guidance should be considered:a) implementing rules and controls that prevent or detect the use of unauthorized software [e.g. application allowlisting (i.e. using a list providing allowed applications)] (see 8.19 and 8.32);b) implementing controls that prevent or detect the use of known or suspected malicious websites (e.g. blocklisting);c) reducing vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malware [e.g. through technical vulnerability management (see 8.8 and 8.19)];d) conducting regular automated validation of the software and data content of systems, especially for systems supporting critical business processes; investigating the presence of any unapproved files or unauthorized amendments;e) establishing protective measures against risks associated with obtaining files and software either from or via external networks or on any other medium;f) installing and regularly updating malware detection and repair software to scan computers and electronic storage media. Carrying out regular scans that include:1) scanning any data received over networks or via any form of electronic storage media, for malware before use;2) scanning email and instant messaging attachments and downloads for malware before use. Carrying out this scan at different places (e.g. at email servers, desktop computers) and when entering the network of the organization;3) scanning webpages for malware when accessed;g) determining the placement and configuration of malware detection and repair tools based on risk assessment outcomes and considering:1) defence in depth principles where they would be most effective. For example, this can lead to malware detection in a network gateway (in various application protocols such as email, file transfer and web) as well as user endpoint devices and servers;2) the evasive techniques of attackers (e.g. the use of encrypted files) to deliver malware or the use of encryption protocols to transmit malware;h) taking care to protect against the introduction of malware during maintenance and emergency procedures, which can bypass normal controls against malware;i) implementing a process to authorize temporarily or permanently disable some or all measures against malware, including exception approval authorities, documented justification and review date. This can be necessary when the protection against malware causes disruption to normal operations;j) preparing appropriate business continuity plans for recovering from malware attacks, including all necessary data and software backup (including both online and offline backup) and recovery measures (see 8.13);k) isolating environments where catastrophic consequences can occur;l) defining procedures and responsibilities to deal with protection against malware on systems, including training in their use, reporting and recovering from malware attacks;m) providing awareness or training (see 6.3) to all users on how to identify and potentially mitigate the receipt, sending or installation of malware infected emails, files or programs [the information collected in n) and o) can be used to ensure awareness and training are kept up-to-date];n) implementing procedures to regularly collect information about new malware, such as subscribing to mailing lists or reviewing relevant websites;o) verifying that information relating to malware, such as warning bulletins, comes from qualified and reputable sources (e.g. reliable internet sites or suppliers of malware detection software) and is accurate and informative.Other informationIt is not always possible to install software that protects against malware on some systems (e.g. some industrial control systems).

Monitoring records should be maintained for defined retention periods.The following should be considered for inclusion within the monitoring system:a) outbound and inbound network, system and application traffic;b) access to systems, servers, networking equipment, monitoring system, critical applications, etc.;c) critical or admin level system and network configuration files;d) logs from security tools [e.g. antivirus, IDS, intrusion prevention system (IPS), web filters, firewalls, data leakage prevention];e) event logs relating to system and network activity;f) checking that the code being executed is authorized to run in the system and that it has not been tampered with (e.g. by recompilation to add additional unwanted code);g) use of the resources (e.g. CPU, hard disks, memory, bandwidth) and their performance.The organization should establish a baseline of normal behaviour and monitor against this baseline for anomalies. When establishing a baseline, the following should be considered:a) reviewing utilization of systems at normal and peak periods;b) usual time of access, location of access, frequency of access for each user or group of users.The monitoring system should be configured against the established baseline to identify anomalous behaviour, such as:a) unplanned termination of processes or applications;b) activity typically associated with malware or traffic originating from known malicious IP addresses or network domains (e.g. those associated with botnet command and control servers);c) known attack characteristics (e.g. denial of service and buffer overflows);d) unusual system behaviour (e.g. keystroke logging, process injection and deviations in use of standard protocols);e) bottlenecks and overloads (e.g. network queuing, latency levels and network jitter);f) unauthorized access (actual or attempted) to systems or information;g) unauthorized scanning of business applications, systems and networks;h) successful and unsuccessful attempts to access protected resources (e.g. DNS servers, web portals and file systems);i) unusual user and system behaviour in relation to expected behaviour.Continuous monitoring via a monitoring tool should be used. Monitoring should be done in real time or in periodic intervals, subject to organizational need and capabilities. Monitoring tools should include the ability to handle large amounts of data, adapt to a constantly changing threat landscape, and allow for real-time notification. The tools should also be able to recognize specific signatures and data or network or application behaviour patterns.Automated monitoring software should be configured to generate alerts (e.g. via management consoles, email messages or instant messaging systems) based on predefined thresholds. The alerting system should be tuned and trained on the organization's baseline to minimize false positives. Personnel should be dedicated to respond to alerts and should be properly trained to accurately interpret potential incidents. There should be redundant systems and processes in place to receive and respond to alert notifications.Abnormal events should be communicated to relevant parties in order to improve the following activities: auditing, security evaluation, vulnerability scanning and monitoring (see 5.25). Procedures should be in place to respond to positive indicators from the monitoring system in a timely manner, in order to minimize the effect of adverse events (see 5.26) on information security. Procedures should also be established to identify and address false positives including tuning the monitoring software to reduce the number of future false positives.Other informationSecurity monitoring can be enhanced by:a) leveraging threat intelligence systems (see 5.7);b) leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities;c) using blocklists or allowlists;d) undertaking a range of technical security assessments (e.g. vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, cyber-attack simulations and cyber response exercises), and using the results of these assessments to help determine baselines or acceptable behaviour;e) using performance monitoring systems to help establish and detect anomalous behaviour;f) leveraging logs in combination with monitoring systems.Monitoring activities are often conducted using specialist software, such as intrusion detection systems. These can be configured to a baseline of normal, acceptable and expected system and network activities.Monitoring for anomalous communications helps in the identification of botnets (i.e. set of devices under the malicious control of the botnet owner, usually used for mounting distributed denial of service attacks on other computers of other organizations). If the computer is being controlled by an external device, there is a communication between the infected device and the controller.

Initial awareness, education and training can apply to new personnel and to those who transfer to new positions or roles with substantially different information security requirements.Personnel's understanding should be assessed at the end of an awareness, education or training activity to test knowledge transfer and the effectiveness of the awareness, education and training programme.AwarenessAn information security awareness programme should aim to make personnel aware of their responsibilities for information security and the means by which those responsibilities are discharged.The awareness programme should be planned taking into consideration the roles of personnel in the organization, including internal and external personnel (e.g. external consultants, supplier personnel). The activities in the awareness programme should be scheduled over time, preferably regularly, so that the activities are repeated and cover new personnel. It should also be built on lessons learnt from information security incidents.The awareness programme should include a number of awareness-raising activities via appropriate physical or virtual channels such as campaigns, booklets, posters, newsletters, websites, information sessions, briefings, e-learning modules and e-mails.Information security awareness should cover general aspects such as:a) management's commitment to information security throughout the organization;b) familiarity and compliance needs concerning applicable information security rules and obligations, taking into account information security policy and topic-specific policies, standards, laws, statutes, regulations, contracts and agreements;c) personal accountability for one's own actions and inactions, and general responsibilities towards securing or protecting information belonging to the organization and interested parties;d) basic information security procedures [e.g. information security event reporting (6.8)] and baseline controls [e.g. password security (5.17)];e) contact points and resources for additional information and advice on information security matters, including further information security awareness materials.Education and trainingThe organization should identify, prepare and implement an appropriate training plan for technical teams whose roles require specific skill sets and expertise. Technical teams should have the skills for configuring and maintaining the required security level for devices, systems, applications and services. If there are missing skills, the organization should take action and acquire them.The education and training programme should consider different forms [e.g. lectures or self-studies, being mentored by expert staff or consultants (on-the-job training), rotating staff members to follow different activities, recruiting already skilled people and hiring consultants]. It can use different means of delivery including classroom-based, distance learning, web-based, self-paced and others. Technical personnel should keep their knowledge up to date by subscribing to newsletters and magazines or by attending conferences and events aimed at technical and professional improvement.Other informationWhen composing an awareness programme, it is important not only to focus on the 'what' and 'how', but also the 'why', when possible. It is important that personnel understand the aim of information security and the potential effect, positive and negative, on the organization of their own behaviour.Information security awareness, education and training can be part of, or conducted in collaboration with, other activities, for example general information management, ICT, security, privacy or safety training.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To ensure personnel and relevant interested parties are aware of and fulfil their information security responsibilities."}]}

Updating the list of information resources based on changes in the inventory or when other new or useful resources are found;c) requiring suppliers of information system (including their components) to ensure vulnerability reporting, handling and disclosure, including the requirements in applicable contracts (see 5.20);d) using vulnerability scanning tools suitable for the technologies in use to identify vulnerabilities and to verify whether the patching of vulnerabilities was successful;e) conducting planned, documented and repeatable penetration tests or vulnerability assessments by competent and authorized persons to support the identification of vulnerabilities. Exercising caution as such activities can lead to a compromise of the security of the system;f) tracking the usage of third-party libraries and source code for vulnerabilities. This should beincluded in secure coding (see 8.28).The organization should develop procedures and capabilities to:a) detect the existence of vulnerabilities in its products and services including any external component used in these;b) receive vulnerability reports from internal or external sources.The organization should provide a public point of contact as part of a topic-specific policy on vulnerability disclosure so that researchers and others are able to report issues. The organization should establish vulnerability reporting procedures, online reporting forms and making use of appropriate threat intelligence or information sharing forums. The organization should also consider bug bounty programswhere rewards are offered as an incentive to assist organizations in identifying vulnerabilities in order to appropriately remediate them. The organization should also share information with competent industry bodies or other interested parties.Evaluating technical vulnerabilitiesTo evaluate identified technical vulnerabilities, the following guidance should be considered:a) analyse and verify reports to determine what response and remediation activity is needed;b) once a potential technical vulnerability has been identified, identifying the associated risks and the actions to be taken. Such actions can involve updating vulnerable systems or applying other controls.Taking appropriate measures to address technical vulnerabilitiesA software update management process should be implemented to ensure the most up-to-date approved patches and application updates are installed for all authorized software. If changes are necessary, the original software should be retained and the changes applied to a designated copy. All changes should be fully tested and documented, so that they can be reapplied, if necessary, to future software upgrades. If required, the modifications should be tested and validated by an independent evaluation body.The following guidance should be considered to address technical vulnerabilities:a) taking appropriate and timely action in response to the identification of potential technical vulnerabilities; defining a timeline to react to notifications of potentially relevant technical vulnerabilities;b) depending on how urgently a technical vulnerability needs to be addressed, carrying out the action according to the controls related to change management (see 8.32) or by following information security incident response procedures (see 5.26);c) only using updates from legitimate sources (which can be internal or external to the organization);d) testing and evaluating updates before they are installed to ensure they are effective and do not result in side effects that cannot be tolerated [i.e. if an update is available, assessing the risks associated with installing the update (the risks posed by the vulnerability should be compared with the risk of installing the update)];e) addressing systems at high risk first;f) develop remediation (typically software updates or patches);g) test to confirm if the remediation or mitigation is effective;h) provide mechanisms to verify the authenticity of remediation;i) if no update is available or the update cannot be installed, considering other controls, such as:1) applying any workaround suggested by the software vendor or other relevant sources;2) turning off services or capabilities related to the vulnerability;3) adapting or adding access controls (e.g. firewalls) at network borders (see 8.20 to 8.22);4) shielding vulnerable systems, devices or applications from attack through deployment of suitable traffic filters (sometimes called virtual patching);5) increasing monitoring to detect actual attacks;6) raising awareness of the vulnerability.For acquired software, if the vendors regularly release information about security updates for their software and provide a facility to install such updates automatically, the organization should decide whether to use the automatic update or not.Other considerationsAn audit log should be kept for all steps undertaken in technical vulnerability management.The technical vulnerability management process should be regularly monitored and evaluated in order to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency.An effective technical vulnerability management process should be aligned with incident management activities, to communicate data on vulnerabilities to the incident response function and provide technical procedures to be carried out in case an incident occurs.Where the organization uses a cloud service supplied by a third-party cloud service provider, technical vulnerability management of cloud service provider resources should be ensured by the cloud service provider. The cloud service provider's responsibilities for technical vulnerability management should be part of the cloud service agreement and this should include processes for reporting the cloud service provider's actions relating to technical vulnerabilities (see 5.23). For some cloud services, there are respective responsibilities for the cloud service provider and the cloud service customer. For example, the cloud service customer is responsible for vulnerability management of its own assets used for the cloud services.Other informationTechnical vulnerability management can be viewed as a sub-function of change management and as such can take advantage of the change management processes and procedures (see 8.32).There is a possibility that an update does not address the problem adequately and has negative side effects. Also, in some cases, uninstalling an update cannot be easily achieved once the update has been applied.If adequate testing of the updates is not possible (e.g. because of costs or lack of resources) a delay in updating can be considered to evaluate the associated risks, based on the experience reported by other users. The use of ISO/IEC 27031 can be beneficial.Where software patches or updates are produced, the organization can consider providing an automated update process where these updates are installed on affected systems or products without the need for intervention by the customer or the user. If an automated update process is offered, it can allow the customer or user to choose an option to turn off the automatic update or control the timing of the installation of the update.Where the vendor provides an automated update process and the updates can be installed on affected systems or products without the need for intervention, the organization determines if it applies the automated process or not. One reason for not electing for automated update is to retain control over when the update is performed. For example, a software used for a business operation cannot be updated until the operation has completed.A weakness with vulnerability scanning is that it is possible it does not fully account for defence in depth: two countermeasures that are always invoked in sequence can have vulnerabilities that are masked by strengths in the other. The composite countermeasure is not vulnerable, whereas a vulnerability scanner can report that both components are vulnerable. The organization should therefore take care in reviewing and acting on vulnerability reports.Many organizations supply software, systems, products and services not only within the organization but also to interested parties such as customers, partners or other users. These software, systems, products and services can have information security vulnerabilities that affect the security of users.Organizations can release remediation and disclose information about vulnerabilities to users (typically through a public advisory) and provide appropriate information for software vulnerability database services.For more information relating to the management of technical vulnerabilities when using cloud computing, see the ISO/IEC 19086 series and ISO/IEC 27017.ISO/IEC 29147 provides detailed information on receiving vulnerability reports and publishing vulnerability advisories. ISO/IEC 30111 provides detailed information about handling and resolving reported vulnerabilities.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vulnerability scanning may not fully account for defense in depth, as it can report vulnerabilities in components that are mitigated by other countermeasures."}]}

These records should be securely stored. This can be achieved in various ways, such as configuration databases or configuration templates.Changes to configurations should follow the change management process (see 8.32). Configuration records can contain as relevant:a) up-to-date owner or point of contact information for the asset;b) date of the last change of configuration;c) version of configuration template;d) relation to configurations of other assets. Monitoring configurationsConfigurations should be monitored with a comprehensive set of system management tools (e.g. maintenance utilities, remote support, enterprise management tools, backup and restore software) and should be reviewed on a regular basis to verify configuration settings, evaluate password strengths and assess activities performed. Actual configurations can be compared with the defined target templates. Any deviations should be addressed, either by automatic enforcement of the defined target configuration or by manual analysis of the deviation followed by corrective actions.Other informationDocumentation for systems often records details about the configuration of both hardware and software.System hardening is a typical part of configuration management.Configuration management can be integrated with asset management processes and associated tooling.

If that is the case, the organization should implement technology such as data leakage prevention tools or the configuration of existing tools that allow users to view and manipulate data held remotely but prevent copy and paste outside of the organization's control.If data export is required, the data owner should be allowed to approve the export and hold users accountable for their actions.Taking screenshots or photographs of the screen should be addressed through terms and conditions of use, training and auditing.Where data is backed up, care should be taken to ensure sensitive information is protected using measures such as encryption, access control and physical protection of the storage media holding the backup.Data leakage prevention should also be considered to protect against the intelligence actions of an adversary from obtaining confidential or secret information (geopolitical, human, financial, commercial, scientific or any other) which can be of interest for espionage or can be critical for the community. The data leakage prevention actions should be oriented to confuse the adversary's decisions for example by replacing authentic information with false information, either as an independent action or as a response to the adversary's intelligence actions. Examples of these kinds of actions are reverse social engineering or the use of honeypots to attract attackers.Other informationData leakage prevention tools are designed to identify data, monitor data usage and movement, and take actions to prevent data from leaking (e.g. alerting users to their risky behaviour and blocking the transfer of data to portable storage devices).Data leakage prevention inherently involves monitoring personnel's communications and online activities, and by extension external party messages, which raises legal concerns that should be considered prior to deploying data leakage prevention tools. There is a variety of legislation relating to privacy, data protection, employment, interception of data and telecommunications that is applicable to monitoring and data processing in the context of data leakage prevention.Data leakage prevention can be supported by standard security controls, such as topic-specific policies on access control and secure document management (see 5.12 and 5.15).\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To detect and prevent the unauthorized disclosure and extraction of information by individuals or systems."}]}

For example, read access to source code can be broadly provided inside the organization, but write access to source codeis only made available to privileged personnel or designated owners. Where code components are used by several developers within an organization, read access to a centralized code repository should be implemented. Furthermore, if open-source code or third-party code components are used inside an organization, read access to such external code repositories can be broadly provided. However, write access should still be restricted.The following guidelines should be considered to control access to program source libraries in order to reduce the potential for corruption of computer programs:a) managing the access to program source code and the program source libraries according to established procedures;b) granting read and write access to source code based on business needs and managed to address risks of alteration or misuse and according to established procedures;c) updating of source code and associated items and granting of access to source code in accordance with change control procedures (see 8.32) and only performing it after appropriate authorization has been received;d) not granting developers direct access to the source code repository, but through developer tools that control activities and authorizations on the source code;e) holding program listings in a secure environment, where read and write access should be appropriately managed and assigned;f) maintaining an audit log of all accesses and of all changes to source code.If the program source code is intended to be published, additional controls to provide assurance on its integrity (e.g. digital signature) should be considered.Other informationIf access to source code is not properly controlled, source code can be modified or some data in the development environment (e.g. copies of production data, configuration details) can be retrieved by unauthorized persons.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Measures include managing access through established procedures, maintaining audit logs of changes, and implementing role-based access controls."}]}

Initial awareness, education and training can apply to new personnel and to those who transfer to new positions or roles with substantially different information security requirements.Personnel's understanding should be assessed at the end of an awareness, education or training activity to test knowledge transfer and the effectiveness of the awareness, education and training programme.AwarenessAn information security awareness programme should aim to make personnel aware of their responsibilities for information security and the means by which those responsibilities are discharged.The awareness programme should be planned taking into consideration the roles of personnel in the organization, including internal and external personnel (e.g. external consultants, supplier personnel). The activities in the awareness programme should be scheduled over time, preferably regularly, so that the activities are repeated and cover new personnel. It should also be built on lessons learnt from information security incidents.The awareness programme should include a number of awareness-raising activities via appropriate physical or virtual channels such as campaigns, booklets, posters, newsletters, websites, information sessions, briefings, e-learning modules and e-mails.Information security awareness should cover general aspects such as:a) management's commitment to information security throughout the organization;b) familiarity and compliance needs concerning applicable information security rules and obligations, taking into account information security policy and topic-specific policies, standards, laws, statutes, regulations, contracts and agreements;c) personal accountability for one's own actions and inactions, and general responsibilities towards securing or protecting information belonging to the organization and interested parties;d) basic information security procedures [e.g. information security event reporting (6.8)] and baseline controls [e.g. password security (5.17)];e) contact points and resources for additional information and advice on information security matters, including further information security awareness materials.Education and trainingThe organization should identify, prepare and implement an appropriate training plan for technical teams whose roles require specific skill sets and expertise. Technical teams should have the skills for configuring and maintaining the required security level for devices, systems, applications and services. If there are missing skills, the organization should take action and acquire them.The education and training programme should consider different forms [e.g. lectures or self-studies, being mentored by expert staff or consultants (on-the-job training), rotating staff members to follow different activities, recruiting already skilled people and hiring consultants]. It can use different means of delivery including classroom-based, distance learning, web-based, self-paced and others.

The organization should design and implement systems architecture with appropriate redundancy to meet these requirements.Redundancy can be introduced by duplicating information processing facilities in part or in their entirety (i.e. spare components or having two of everything). The organization should plan and implement procedures for the activation of the redundant components and processing facilities. The procedures should establish if the redundant components and processing activities are always activated, or in case of emergency, automatically or manually activated. The redundant components and information processing facilities should ensure the same security level as the primary ones.Mechanisms should be in place to alert the organization to any failure in the information processing facilities, enable executing the planned procedure and allow continued availability while the information processing facilities are repaired or replaced.The organization should consider the following when implementing redundant systems:a) contracting with two or more suppliers of network and critical information processing facilities such as internet service providers;b) using redundant networks;c) using two geographically separate data centres with mirrored systems;d) using physically redundant power supplies or sources;e) using multiple parallel instances of software components, with automatic load balancing between them (between instances in the same data centre or in different data centres);f) having duplicated components in systems (e.g. CPU, hard disks, memories) or in networks (e.g. firewalls, routers, switches).Where applicable, preferably in production mode, redundant information systems should be tested to ensure the failover from one component to another component works as intended.Other informationThere is a strong relationship between redundancy and ICT readiness for business continuity (see 5.30) especially if short recovery times are required. Many of the redundancy measures can be part of the ICT continuity strategies and solutions.The implementation of redundancies can introduce risks to the integrity (e.g. processes of copying data to duplicated components can introduce errors) or confidentiality (e.g. weak security control of duplicated components can lead to compromise) of information and information systems, which need to be considered when designing information systems.Redundancy in information processing facilities does not usually address application unavailability due to faults within an application.With the use of public cloud computing, it is possible to have multiple live versions of information processing facilities, existing in multiple separate physical locations with automatic failover and load balancing between them.Some of the technologies and techniques for providing redundancy and automatic fail-over in the context of cloud services are discussed in ISO/IEC TS 23167.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The organization should plan and implement procedures for the activation of the redundant components and processing facilities.

See 7.10 for detailed guidance on secure disposal of storage media and 8.10 for guidance on information deletion.Labels and markings identifying the organization or indicating the classification, owner, system or network, should be removed prior to disposal, including reselling or donating to charity.The organization should consider the removal of security controls such as access controls or surveillance equipment at the end of lease or when moving out of premises. This depends on factors such as:a) its lease agreement to return the facility to original condition;b) minimizing the risk of leaving systems with sensitive information on them for the next tenant (e.g. user access lists, video or image files);c) the ability to reuse the controls at the next facility.Other informationDamaged equipment containing storage media can require a risk assessment to determine whether the items should be physically destroyed rather than sent for repair or discarded. Information can be compromised through careless disposal or re-use of equipment.In addition to secure disk deletion, full-disk encryption reduces the risk of disclosure of confidential information when equipment is disposed of or redeployed, provided that:a) the encryption process is sufficiently strong and covers the entire disk (including slack space, swap files);b) the cryptographic keys are long enough to resist brute force attacks;c) the cryptographic keys are themselves kept confidential (e.g. never stored on the same disk). For further advice on cryptography, see 8.24.Techniques for securely overwriting storage media differ according to the storage media technology and the classification level of the information on the storage media. Overwriting tools should be reviewed to make sure that they are applicable to the technology of the storage media.See ISO/IEC 27040 for detail on methods for sanitizing storage media.\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Considerations include lease agreements, minimizing risks for future tenants, and reusability of controls in the new facility."}]}
