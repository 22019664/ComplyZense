### API Security

- Authentication & Authorization:
Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access certain endpoints.
Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict actions based on user roles.

- Encryption:
Use HTTPS for secure communication.
Encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g., scan results) and in transit.

- Rate Limiting:
Protect the API from abuse by implementing rate limiting, especially for heavy operations like scanning and report generation.
