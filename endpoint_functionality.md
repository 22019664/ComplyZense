### API Endpoint Functionality

- Network Scan (POST /scan/network):
Backend Implementation:
The backend will use Nmap or another scanning tool to discover devices in the given IP range and their services.
The result is stored in a database with a unique scan_id to reference the scan later.

- Compliance Verification (POST /compliance/verify):
Backend Implementation:
The backend will retrieve the scan results associated with the provided scan_id and compare them with the selected compliance standards.
For GDPR, this could involve checking for data storage locations, encryption, and access control compliance.

- Real-time Alerts (POST /alerts):
Backend Implementation:
The backend will monitor events (e.g., unauthorized access) and trigger alerts if conditions meet the thresholds defined in the request.
Alerts will be logged and can trigger notifications (via email, UI pop-ups, etc.).

- Report Generation (GET /reports/{scan_id}):
Backend Implementation:
The backend will generate a report (PDF, CSV, etc.) summarizing the results of the scan and compliance check.
A PDF generation library such as ReportLab or PDFKit can be used to generate downloadable reports.

- Train LLM (POST /train-LLM):
Backend Implementation:
The backend will accept a new policy text, train the LLM with the new data, and integrate it into the compliance checking process.
This would likely involve passing the new policy to a model hosted on a separate service or server.
